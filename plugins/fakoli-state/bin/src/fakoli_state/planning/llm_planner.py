"""LLM-driven task generation when a PRD has features + requirements but no
``## Tasks`` section.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Before v1.15.0, ``fakoli-state plan`` only emitted Task events for tasks
already authored in the PRD's ``## Tasks`` block. If the user authored a PRD
with goals/requirements/features only — the common case for a starter PRD —
the CLI would happily exit 0 with ``Planned N features, 0 tasks`` and the
agent was expected to *remember* to dispatch the ``fakoli-state:planner``
subagent as a workaround. That "agent must remember" pattern was the bug.

This module is the deterministic backstop: when ``plan`` finds zero tasks,
the CLI calls :func:`generate_tasks_markdown`, which calls an LLM to draft
``### TXXX:`` blocks from the features + requirements. The output is markdown
that ``planning.template.parse_prd`` can consume — round-tripping through the
same data format avoids duplicating any parsing logic.

Provider precedence (v1.17.0)
-----------------------------
:func:`resolve_planner_provider` picks **exactly one** provider per call,
in this order:

1. **Explicit config** — ``Config.llm_provider`` resolves to one of
   ``anthropic`` / ``bedrock`` / ``custom``. Always wins when set.
2. **Env auto-detect** — when config is silent, choose by which credential
   is present:
   - ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` → ``anthropic`` (cheapest path; works inside
     Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or any shell with the key).
   - ``AWS_REGION`` / ``AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`` (and the ``anthropic[bedrock]``
     extras are importable) → ``bedrock``. ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` takes
     precedence because direct API is cheaper per token; users who want
     Bedrock pinning even when their key is set MUST set ``llm_provider:
     bedrock`` in config.
   - ``CUSTOM_LLM_BASE_URL`` → ``custom``. Same pinning rule applies.
3. **Fail loudly** with a multi-line message naming every supported path.
   We do NOT silent-fall-through to a different provider mid-process —
   that breaks billing predictability and surprises ops teams during
   incidents (community consensus, May 2026).

Tier resolution
---------------
After the provider is chosen, the model id comes from:

1. ``Config.llm_model`` explicit → wins, passed through verbatim.
2. ``Config.llm_tier`` (``opus``/``sonnet``/``haiku``) → resolved via
   :data:`MODEL_TIERS` (or :data:`BEDROCK_MODEL_TIERS` for Bedrock).
3. :data:`DEFAULT_TIER` (Sonnet) → safe community default.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a PRD-to-tasks planner. The user has authored a PRD with goals,
requirements, and features but has not yet authored individual tasks. Your
job is to produce a `## Tasks` markdown section that the fakoli-state parser
can consume directly.

# Output format — STRICT

Output ONLY a `## Tasks` section. Nothing before it; nothing after it. No
explanatory prose, no commentary, no surrounding fences.

The exact structure expected (one `### TXXX: Title` block per task, with the
required `**Bold:**` fields present and non-empty):

## Tasks

### T001: <imperative verb-phrase title>

**Feature:** F001
**Priority:** medium
**Likely files:** path/to/file1.py, path/to/file2.py
**Dependencies:** T002, T003

<One-paragraph description of intent. Implementation-agnostic. Names what
must be true when the task is done, NOT which file to edit or which
library to use. The implementing agent picks the approach.>

**Acceptance criteria:**

- <Verifiable statement 1.>
- <Verifiable statement 2.>

**Verification:**

- `<one shell command that demonstrates the criteria pass>`
- `<another shell command, if useful>`

### T002: <next task>

… (same shape)

The `**Dependencies:**` field is OPTIONAL — omit it entirely when the task
has no dependencies. When present, it is a comma-separated list of TaskIDs
this task semantically depends on (those tasks must reach `done` status
before this task can be meaningfully claimed). It is NOT for "tasks I share
files with" — file overlap is detected automatically as conflict groups.

# Rules

- IDs are zero-padded three digits: T001, T002, ..., T019. Do NOT skip numbers.
- Every task MUST reference an existing Feature (one of the F00N IDs from
  the PRD). If a task spans multiple features, pick the dominant one and
  mention the secondary in the description.
- Priority is one of: low, medium, high, critical. Default to medium unless
  the requirement text justifies otherwise.
- Likely files MUST be plausible paths inferred from the PRD or the
  project's likely layout — never fabricate filenames that contradict the
  PRD's tech-stack hints. If unsure, use a generic path like
  `src/<feature-slug>/<intent>.py`.
- Acceptance criteria MUST be checkable without human judgment. "Tests
  pass" is acceptable; "The code is clean" is not.
- Verification MUST include at least one shell command. `pytest path/...`,
  `npm test`, `cargo test`, or `python -m <module> --help` are common
  shapes. NEVER leave verification empty.

# Dependencies (CRITICAL — read carefully)

A `**Dependencies:**` field exists for tasks that semantically depend on
other tasks (NOT just tasks that touch the same files — file overlap is
detected automatically as conflict groups). Emit `**Dependencies:**` when
EITHER of these is true:

1. **Infrastructure dependency.** Task A creates infrastructure
   (an API, a service, a transport, a schema, a CLI command) that Task B
   needs to function. Example: T001 implements `HttpTransport`; T002
   tests `HttpTransport` in 2-process mode → T002 depends on T001.
2. **Phrasal dependency in acceptance criteria.** If a task's acceptance
   criteria say "in X mode", "using Y", "after Z is complete", or
   "given the W from <other task>", that's a dependency.
   - "Test the system in 2-process mode" → depends on the task that
     implements 2-process mode.
   - "Migrate existing data to the new schema" → depends on the task
     that adds the new schema.
   - "Render the audit log via the new endpoint" → depends on the task
     that adds the endpoint.

Do NOT emit dependencies for:
- Tasks that merely touch the same files (handled by conflict groups)
- Tasks that share a Feature but are independent in scope
- Tasks where you're guessing — only emit when the dependency is concrete
  and named in the criteria or implied by infrastructure ordering

Avoid cycles: if Task A depends on B and B depends on A, you've
mis-identified one — re-read the criteria and pick the correct direction.
The dependency direction is always "later task depends on earlier task"
(later in the workflow / infrastructure-consumer depends on
infrastructure-producer).

Omit the `**Dependencies:**` line entirely when the task has no
dependencies — do NOT emit an empty `**Dependencies:**` field.

# Sizing

- Aim for ~4-8 hours of focused work per task. A task that smells larger
  is acceptable — flag it in the description as "may need expand" — but
  don't pack a whole feature into one task.
- The total task count should reflect the scope of the PRD's features and
  requirements. A PRD with 3 features and 12 requirements typically lands
  at 10-20 tasks.

    """Generate a ``## Tasks`` markdown section via LLM.

    Args:
        prd: Parsed PRD model — provides summary/goals/non-goals context.
        features: All Feature objects from the PRD. Tasks will reference
            these by ID.
        requirements: All Requirement objects. The LLM derives tasks that
            satisfy these.
        existing_tasks: Optional list of already-authored tasks. When
            provided, the LLM is told NOT to re-propose them and to
            continue the ID sequence from the next available number.
            Use for incremental planning after a PRD revision.
        provider: Optional :class:`LLMProvider` override (for tests).
            When ``None``, :func:`resolve_planner_provider` picks one based
            on ``config``.
        config: Optional :class:`fakoli_state.config.Config`. Threaded into
            :func:`resolve_planner_provider` so the project's explicit
            ``llm_provider`` / ``llm_tier`` / Bedrock+custom knobs are
            honored. Ignored when ``provider`` is supplied.
        max_tokens: Per-completion ceiling. Default 8000 supports ~20
            tasks with full acceptance criteria + verification.

    Returns:
        :class:`TaskGenerationResult` with the generated markdown, task
        count, and provider label.

        PlannerProviderUnavailable: No LLM tier is set up.
