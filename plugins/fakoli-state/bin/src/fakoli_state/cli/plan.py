"""plan, score, expand, review tasks, list, show commands (Phase 3).

Phase 7 Wave 2: plan / score / expand grow a ``--use-llm`` flag that, when
set, instantiates an :class:`fakoli_state.planning.llm.AnthropicProvider`

augmentation is *additive* — the deterministic baseline always runs first;
LLM enrichment is layered on top and may fail open with a stderr warning.

    - ``**Priority:**`` — populated from ``parent_priority`` when supplied;
      defaults to ``medium`` so the block is valid PRD input without further
      editing.  Inheriting the parent's priority is the right default

    - ``**Acceptance criteria:**`` — bulleted list, omitted when empty.
    - ``**Verification:**`` — bulleted list, populated with a single
      placeholder ``- TODO: add verification command`` so the block is not
      missing the field; the user replaces it before approving.
