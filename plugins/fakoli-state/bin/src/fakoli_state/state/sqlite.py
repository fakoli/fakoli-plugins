"""SQLite backend implementing the Backend protocol.

WAL mode + JSONL audit log.  The replay guarantee:
    replay_from_empty(events.jsonl) → state.db identical to original run.

Events are serialised to JSONL *before* the SQLite mutation so that even a
process crash after the JSONL write but before the COMMIT leaves the log
in a state that can be replayed cleanly.

Phase 2 note: only 'project.created' and 'state.initialized' are routed;
Phase 3 extends routing with: prd.parsed, prd.reviewed, prd.approved,
feature.created, task.created, task.scored, task.expanded, task.status_changed.
Phase 4 extends routing with: claim.created, claim.released, claim.renewed,
claim.stale.
Phase 5 extends routing with: evidence.submitted, task.applied.
