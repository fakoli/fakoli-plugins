"""Canonical-state snapshot — the semantic definition of "the state the system
cares about", as a deterministic, JSON-serialisable structure.

This module exposes a single pure function, :func:`serialize_state`, used by the
SL-1 replay-equivalence test: it snapshots a normally-built backend and a
replayed backend, then byte-compares the two via ``json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)``.

Design contract
---------------
- **Read-only.** ``serialize_state`` calls only the backend's read API. It never
  writes, never reads the clock, and never touches the filesystem beyond the
  backend's own queries. It reaches through the Backend protocol, never into
  SQLite directly.
- **Total.** Every canonical collection is covered: project, prd, features,
  tasks, claims (ALL of them — active, released, stale, force_released),
  reviews, evidence, requirements, and sync mappings.

  Intentionally excluded tables: ``decisions`` and ``conflict_groups`` exist in
  the schema but are never written by any current handler — they are always empty
  and cannot diverge between a normal run and a replay. If a writer is added for
  either table, this snapshot MUST be extended at the same time or
  replay-equivalence will silently stop covering that table.

- **Deterministic.** Each collection is sorted by a stable key before
  serialisation, and every model is dumped via pydantic ``model_dump(mode="json")``
  so datetimes/enums serialise to stable strings. The result satisfies:

      json.dumps(serialize_state(b), sort_keys=True)

  being byte-identical across repeated calls on the same backend. ``sort_keys``
  handles object-key ordering; this module's job is collection-element ordering.

Output shape (the contract downstream fixtures/tests depend on)
---------------------------------------------------------------
``serialize_state`` returns a ``dict`` with exactly these top-level keys::

    {
      "project":       <object> | None,     # single Project, or None
      "prd":           <object> | None,     # single PRD, or None
      "features":      [<object>, ...],      # sorted by id
      "tasks":         [<object>, ...],      # sorted by id
      "claims":        [<object>, ...],      # ALL claims, sorted by id
      "reviews":       [<object>, ...],      # sorted by id
      "evidence":      [<object>, ...],      # sorted by id
      "requirements":  [<object>, ...],      # sorted by id
      "sync_mappings": [<object>, ...],      # sorted by (task_id, external_system)
    }

Each ``<object>`` is the corresponding model's ``model_dump(mode="json")``.
``project`` and ``prd`` are singletons (the backend exposes ``get_project`` /
``get_prd`` returning one-or-None), so they are emitted as a single object or
``None`` rather than a list.
