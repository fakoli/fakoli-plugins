"""Per-action Pydantic v2 payload models for _apply_mutation dispatch.

Each model corresponds to exactly one event action.  ``extra='forbid'`` is set
on every model so that unknown keys raise ``ValidationError`` at the point of
dispatch — before any handler body executes.  This centralises payload validation
that was previously scattered across 17 handler bodies as ad-hoc ``payload.get``
lookups.

Handlers receive the validated typed model instead of the raw ``dict[str, Any]``.
They access fields via attribute access (``payload.project_id``) rather than
``payload.get("project_id")``.

The ``Any`` type is kept for list-of-dict fields (e.g. ``requirements``,
``subtasks``) because those sub-dicts are themselves validated by Pydantic models
inside the handler bodies (``Requirement.model_validate``, ``Task.model_validate``).
Constraining them here would duplicate that validation.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Phase 8 Wave 3 — sync.* audit events (Task 6 / cli/sync.py)
# Phase 9 T3 — discriminated union (one concrete subclass per `sync.*` action)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every push / pull / conflict / batch operation emits a `sync.*` action
# whose handler is an audit-only no-op (like ``file_changed`` and
# ``progress.noted``).  The JSONL row IS the audit record; no SQLite mutation
# is performed by these events themselves.  The actual mapping persistence
# happens via the existing ``sync_mapping.upserted`` event, kept separate so
# replay-from-empty can reconstruct mappings without depending on ``sync.*``.
#
# Phase 8 used a SINGLE all-optional ``SyncAuditPayload`` model — every field
# was ``str | None = None``.  That accepted ``strategy="foo"`` on a
# ``sync.batch.completed`` event without complaint, and missed the chance to
# enforce that ``sync.push.failed`` actually carries an
# ``exception_message``.  Phase 9 T3 replaces it with a Pydantic v2
# discriminated union: each action has its own subclass with only the fields
# that action actually carries, ``extra="forbid"`` rejects unknown keys, and
# the discriminator dispatches O(1) on the ``action`` literal.
#
# Backwards compatibility:
# * ``SyncAuditPayload`` is preserved as a module-level type-form —
#   ``Annotated[Union[...], Field(discriminator="action")]`` — so existing
#   imports still resolve.  This is NOT a ``typing.TypeAlias`` (no
#   ``: TypeAlias =`` annotation) and NOT a ``BaseModel`` subclass; it is a
#   Pydantic discriminated-union *type form*.  Callers that used to write
#   ``SyncAuditPayload.model_validate(d)`` directly MUST migrate to
#   ``TypeAdapter(SyncAuditPayload).validate_python(d)`` OR look up the
#   concrete subclass from ``ACTION_TO_PAYLOAD``.
# * ``ACTION_TO_PAYLOAD`` maps each ``sync.*`` action string to its concrete
#   subclass for direct dispatcher lookup
#   (``state/sqlite.py:_apply_mutation`` is the obvious consumer).
#
# Action coverage — the T3 plan enumerates 10 action strings (push.{started,
# completed, deferred, failed}, pull.{started, completed, deferred, failed},
# reconciliation.{started, completed}).  ``cli/sync.py`` ALSO emits
# ``sync.batch.{started, completed}`` and ``sync.conflict_detected`` today,
# and ``state/sqlite.py``'s dispatch table registers all of them against
# ``SyncAuditPayload``.  Omitting them from the union would break the
# dispatcher the moment T3 lands.  We therefore include subclasses for the
# emitted-today set as well; the T3-listed reconciliation events are
# included for forward-compat (no emitter today; T5+ may add them).
