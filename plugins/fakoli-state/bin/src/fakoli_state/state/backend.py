"""Storage backend protocol for fakoli-state.

Defines the Backend Protocol that all storage implementations must satisfy,
plus the exception hierarchy for backend failures.

The SQLite implementation lives in state/sqlite.py (Wave 2).
This file ships the contract only — no I/O, no imports of concrete modules.

SL1-RR-1 (write-path rework): The ``append(EventDraft) -> Event | None``
method replaces the retired ``apply_event`` entry point. ``EventDraft`` carries
the intended mutation without an assigned id; the backend validates, assigns the
next monotonic id from the log, appends log-first, then applies the mutation.
``PENDING_EVENT_ID`` sentinel and ``apply_event`` / ``next_event_id`` are
fully removed (Task 6 migration complete).
