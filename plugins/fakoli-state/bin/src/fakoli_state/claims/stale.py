"""Stale-claim detector and reaper.

detect_and_release_stale() is idempotent: safe to call on every CLI invocation
and from the Phase 6 MCP server without coordination.

Event actions emitted (welder maps to SQL handlers):

claim.stale payload_json:
  {
    "claim_id": str,
    "task_id": str,
    "expired_at": str,        # claim.lease_expires_at ISO 8601 UTC
    "detected_at": str,       # clock.now() ISO 8601 UTC
    "actor": str,             # "system" by default
  }

The claim.stale handler (welder) must:
  1. SET claims.status = 'stale' WHERE id = claim_id AND status = 'active'
  2. Emit or directly apply task.status_changed (claimed/in_progress → stale → ready)
     — either as a compound handler or by routing to _handle_task_status_changed twice.

    """Scan active claims and emit claim.stale for any with an expired lease.

    Idempotent: claims already in 'stale' status are returned by
    list_active_claims() only if that method filters on status='active'
    (which the SqliteBackend implementation does).  Re-running this function
    after welder's handler has transitioned the claim to 'stale' will
    therefore naturally skip already-reaped claims.

    A per-claim try/except ensures one bad claim (e.g. its task was already
    deleted by a concurrent operation) does not prevent the others from being
    reaped.

    Args:
        backend: Backend instance to query and mutate via append().
        clock:   Clock instance — all timestamp generation goes through this.
        actor:   Identity for the emitted events (default: "system").

    Returns:
        List of claim IDs that were marked stale in this invocation.
