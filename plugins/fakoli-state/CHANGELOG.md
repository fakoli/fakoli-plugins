## [Unreleased]

Phases 4-8 are planned and actively scheduled. Each phase ships as its own PR into the fakoli-plugins monorepo.

- **Phase 4** — Claims manager: `claim`, `release`, `renew`, `next` CLI commands, git branch auto-creation on claim, claim skill, `check-claim.sh` and `record-file-change.sh` hooks, and tests.
- **Phase 5** — Context engine: `packet`, `submit`, `apply` CLI commands, Review engine apply gate, execute and finish skills, `capture-evidence.sh` hook, critic and sentinel agents, and tests.
- **Phase 6** — MCP server: 13 agent-facing tools, `.mcp.json` wiring, `bin/fakoli-state-mcp` bash wrapper, MCP integration tests, and `docs/mcp.md`.
- **Phase 7** — LLM augmentation: Anthropic provider implementation, `--use-llm` flags on `plan`, `score`, `expand`, RecordedLLMProvider for tests, and brainstorm skill bridge to `fakoli-flow:brainstorm`.
- **Phase 8** — GitHub sync: bidirectional Issues sync engine, `sync github` CLI command, state-keeper agent, reconciliation (`sync --fix`), nightly live-GitHub CI, `docs/github-sync.md`, marketplace.json regen, and feature-complete release. Phases 2-8 will be released as successive minor versions on top of 1.0.0.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-24

Phase 3: Planning engine. Delivers the full planning runtime — deterministic PRD parser, six-dimension scoring engine, dependency and conflict-group inference, eight new CLI subcommands, two new skills, a new agent, and a PRD template doc. The plugin now supports the complete PRD-to-ready-tasks workflow without LLM augmentation.

### Added

- Planning engine: deterministic template parser (`planning/template.py` — turns structured markdown into Pydantic Requirements/Features/Tasks; full quick-start example documented at `docs/prd-template.md`).
- Six-dimension scoring engine (`planning/scoring.py` — rule-based heuristics for complexity, parallelizability, context_load, blast_radius, review_risk, agent_suitability; explanation string per task).
- Dependency and conflict-group inference (`planning/inference.py` — subset-overlap heuristic for dependencies, partial-overlap detection for conflict groups).
- Eight new CLI subcommands: `prd parse`, `prd review [--approve]`, `plan`, `score [TASK_ID]`, `expand TASK_ID` (Phase 7 scaffold), `review tasks`, `list [--status STATUS --feature F]`, `show TASK_ID`.
- Two new skills: `skills/prd/` (PRD authoring/review workflow) and `skills/plan/` (PRD → ready tasks workflow), both following the state-ops imperative-voice and scannable-description conventions.
- New agent: `agents/planner.md` (PRD-to-tasks specialist; defers to `fakoli-crew:guido` when fakoli-crew is installed; allowed-tools excludes Edit/Write to enforce the "propose, don't mutate" Iron Rule at the tool-permission level).
- PRD template doc (`docs/prd-template.md` — ~2,500 words; quick-start JSON-to-YAML converter example demonstrates every documented field).
- SQLite event router extended with 8 new actions: `prd.parsed`, `prd.reviewed`, `prd.approved`, `feature.created`, `task.created`, `task.scored`, `task.expanded`, `task.status_changed`; all routed via `_apply_mutation` dispatch; replay-from-empty handles all 8.

### Fixed

- `_insert_task_row` switched from `INSERT OR REPLACE` to `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` to preserve task row identity across `plan` re-runs. `INSERT OR REPLACE` is DELETE+INSERT, which trips `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on `claims.task_id` and `evidence.task_id` once work has begun. Regression test: `test_plan_is_idempotent`.

### Tests

- 122 new tests (174 → 296). `state/` coverage 95.05% (audit-critical), `planning/` ~93%, `cli` ~88%, overall 92.72%.
- Audit guarantee extended: `test_replay_includes_new_event_actions` byte-compares `sqlite3 .dump` before/after replaying a mixed sequence of all 8 new event actions.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-24

Phase 2: State engine. Delivers the full runtime core — data models, state machine, SQLite backend, event log, CLI, skill, hook, and test suite. The plugin is now operationally useful for tracking project state.

### Added

- State engine: Pydantic v2 models (14 entities) in `state/models.py` — `Project`, `Requirement`, `Feature`, `Task`, `Claim`, `Evidence`, `FileChange`, `Snapshot`, `TaskScore`, `SnapshotEntry`, `Config`, and supporting enums (`TaskStatus`, `ClaimStatus`, `EvidenceKind`).
- Pure state machine transitions in `state/transitions.py` — 17 transition functions plus `TransitionError` and gate helper predicates; no I/O, fully deterministic.
- Backend Protocol + concrete `SqliteBackend` in `state/sqlite.py` — WAL journal mode, JSONL event log (`events.jsonl`) written atomically on every mutation, full replay guarantee.
- DDL schema generator (`state/schema.py`) — foreign keys, composite indexes, schema versioning table; generates idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` SQL.
- Clock Protocol with `SystemClock` and `FrozenClock` for deterministic tests — injected via `SqliteBackend(clock=...)`.
- Config loader (`config.py`) — reads `config.yaml` from the `.fakoli-state/` directory; Pydantic-validated; falls back to sensible defaults.
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker — `fakoli_state` is now a typed package.
- CLI subcommand `init` — scaffolds `.fakoli-state/` directory in the caller's project: `config.yaml`, `state.db`, `events.jsonl`, `prd.md`, `packets/`, and `snapshots/`. Fixed a wrapper bug (`--project "$BIN_DIR"` → wrapper now passes `--project` to preserve the caller's working directory so `init` scaffolds in the correct location).
- CLI subcommand `status` — human-readable summary of project state; `--hook-format` flag emits compact key=value pairs for hook consumption.
- First skill: `state-ops` — covers common state inspection and manipulation workflows from within Claude Code.
- `SessionStart` hook `detect-state.sh` — detects `.fakoli-state/state.db` in the project root on session start and surfaces a brief status banner to the agent.
- 173 tests covering `state/models.py`, `state/transitions.py`, `state/sqlite.py`, CLI (`init`, `status`, `--version`), `config.py`, and the `detect-state.sh` hook; 94% overall coverage, 95% on `state/`.
- Audit-guarantee test `test_replay_from_empty_reconstructs_state_exactly` — replays `events.jsonl` from scratch against an empty database and asserts byte-for-byte equality with the live `state.db`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-24

Phase 1: Plugin scaffold. No executable state operations ship in this release — this entry records the structural foundation that all subsequent phases build on. Version 1.0.0 follows the fakoli-plugins repository convention that new plugins ship at 1.0.0 regardless of feature completeness (per `CLAUDE.md` § New Plugin Checklist).

### Added

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest declaring name, version (`1.0.0`), description, author, repository, license, and marketplace keywords.
- `README.md` — positions fakoli-state against CCPM and issue-tracker-as-state patterns; documents the "5 must-do-better" list; install instructions (git clone until marketplace publication); Quick Start teaser for the intended `fakoli-state init` flow; architecture overview; 8-phase build status table; integration notes for fakoli-flow and fakoli-crew.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file; Keep a Changelog format.
- `LICENSE` — MIT license, copyright 2026 Sekou Doumbouya.
- `docs/specs/2026-05-24-fakoli-state-v0.md` — canonical build specification: data model, CLI command set, MCP tool surface, hook event mappings, phasing plan, and integration contracts.
- `bin/fakoli-state` — bash wrapper that invokes `uv run python -m fakoli_state.cli`; `--version` stub returns `1.0.0`.
- `bin/fakoli-state-mcp` — bash wrapper that invokes `uv run python -m fakoli_state.mcp_server`; stubbed pending Phase 6 with a clean error message instead of a raw Python traceback.
- `bin/pyproject.toml` — uv-managed Python project (Hatchling build backend); declares dependencies: Typer, Pydantic v2, FastMCP, and test tooling (pytest, ruff, mypy, responses).
- `bin/uv.lock` — locked dependency tree for reproducible installs.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/__init__.py` — package init; exports `__version__ = "1.0.0"`.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/cli.py` — Typer application; single `--version` flag functional; all other subcommands stubbed with `typer.echo("Not yet implemented")`.
- Skeleton directories establishing the plugin layout: `skills/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `tests/`, `docs/`.
