# Changelog

All notable changes to fakoli-state are documented here. This project adheres to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

_No unreleased changes._

---

## [1.18.2] — 2026-06-01

### Added

- Roadmap: deferral note for semantic indexing (`sqlite-vec`) and a knowledge-graph view. Useful after Wave 1 (SL-5 contract conflicts, SL-6 spec assumptions) but kept **outside the replay boundary** as rebuildable derived indexes — never canonical state in `events.jsonl`. Cross-references fakoli-style principle P11. Docs-only.

---

## [1.18.1] — 2026-06-01

### Added

- Operating-model up-links: `_evidence_complete` (the unified evidence gate) and the integrity-first roadmap track now back-reference their fakoli-style principles (**P1** advisory and enforcing share one code path; **P5** sequence by credibility risk). Documentation-only; no behavior change.

---

## [1.18.0] — 2026-05-31

### Added

- `docs/roadmap.md` — **integrity-first 90-day priority track.** A committed direction that sits above the version buckets, sequenced by credibility risk: Wave 1 (days 1-30) makes existing claims true (prove replay in CI, measure the critic false-pass rate, plus the already-shipped evidence-gate unification), Wave 2 (days 31-60) makes governance non-gameable (typed `ProofArtifact` evidence, scoring spec assumptions), Wave 3 (days 61-90) earns the "state layer underneath a dynamic-workflow runtime" reframe (promote status-file coordination to canonical state, contract-level conflict detection, a workflow-adapter spike). Documents the three integration postures (beside / governed step / projection) and the two new types (`ProofArtifact`, `OutputContract`) the track introduces.

---

## [1.17.1] — 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- **Evidence gate divergence (correctness).** The `needs_review → accepted` transition enforced a different evidence check than the one `fakoli-state apply` previews to the reviewer. The transition used a raw, case-sensitive substring match against a flattened corpus of every `Evidence` field, while `apply` (`cli/packet_apply.py`) used the intent-based `review.gates.evidence_complete`. The two could disagree in both directions: a task could preview as INCOMPLETE yet be accepted, or preview as complete yet be rejected. The substring gate was also trivially gameable — writing a required literal (e.g. `"test output"`) into any field passed it, and `pytest --collect-only` satisfied a "tests pass" requirement. `transitions._evidence_complete` now delegates to `review.gates.evidence_complete`, making it the single source of truth. A parametrized agreement test locks the enforcing gate to the preview gate so they can never diverge again.

---

## [1.17.0] — 2026-05-26

Major capability release: **multi-provider LLM access** (direct Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI-compatible custom endpoints) plus **tier-aware default model selection** that drops typical session cost by ~60% versus the prior "everything routes through Opus" pattern. The five plugin-surface critics extract to a new dedicated `fakoli-plugin-critic` plugin (`fakoli-crew` 2.3.0+ no longer ships them).

### Added

- `planning/llm.BedrockProvider` — Anthropic-on-Bedrock via `anthropic.AnthropicBedrock`. Boto3 credential chain (env vars / profile / IAM role) just works. Optional dep: `pip install 'fakoli-state[bedrock]'`.
- `planning/llm.CustomEndpointProvider` — any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint via the `openai` SDK with `base_url=`. Targets vLLM, LiteLLM proxy, OpenRouter, Together, Groq, Azure OpenAI, local llama.cpp. Optional dep: `pip install 'fakoli-state[custom]'`.
- `planning/llm.MODEL_TIERS`, `BEDROCK_MODEL_TIERS`, `DEFAULT_TIER`, `resolve_model_for_tier()` — tier vocabulary (`opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku`) and the helper that maps a logical tier to the right model id for each provider's namespace.
- `Config` fields: `llm_provider` (anthropic/bedrock/custom), `llm_tier` (opus/sonnet/haiku), `bedrock_region`, `bedrock_profile`, `custom_base_url`, `custom_api_key_env`. All optional; env auto-detect kicks in when blank.
- `docs/llm-providers.md` — provider setup guide with worked examples for direct API, Bedrock (env / profile / IAM), and three custom-endpoint shapes (vLLM, OpenRouter, LiteLLM proxy).
- `docs/model-strategy.md` — tier rationale, per-agent assignments, override precedence, May 2026 cost figures, and the rationale for *not* shipping a dynamic complexity router by default.
- `[bedrock]` / `[custom]` / `[all-providers]` optional extras in `pyproject.toml` so the default install stays lean (no boto3, no openai) for users on the Anthropic-API-only path.
- Test coverage: `TestResolvePlannerProvider` (8 new tests covering env auto-detect precedence, config overrides, tier threading); `TestResolveModelForTier` (3 tests for direct-API + Bedrock tier tables + error on unknown tier); `TestCustomEndpointProvider` (2 tests for required-model and required-base_url validation).

### Changed

- `planning/llm_planner.resolve_planner_provider()` — gained an optional `config: Config | None` parameter. New precedence: explicit `config.llm_provider` > env auto-detect (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` > `AWS_REGION`+bedrock-extras > `CUSTOM_LLM_BASE_URL`) > fail loudly. Single provider per process; no silent fallback across providers.
- `generate_tasks_markdown()` — gained an optional `config:` parameter, threaded through to the resolver so projects' explicit provider+tier+credential knobs apply.
- `cli/plan._resolve_llm_provider()` — delegates to `resolve_planner_provider(config)` so `--use-llm` augmentation honors the same multi-provider precedence as the no-tasks LLM backstop. Single source of truth for provider selection across the CLI.
- `cli/plan._load_config_optional()` — new helper that soft-loads `.fakoli-state/config.yaml` and emits a stderr warning naming the exception class on load failure. Mirrors `cli/claim.py`'s existing pattern.
- `AnthropicProvider` — gained `tier=` kwarg (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku), resolves via `MODEL_TIERS`. Existing `model=` arg still wins when both are passed; backward compatible for every existing caller.
- Default model tier across the codebase shifts from "Sonnet (hardcoded constant)" to `DEFAULT_TIER = "sonnet"` (community consensus per anthropics/claude-code#27665). Functional behaviour unchanged on the default path; the change is documentation + config plumbing.
- Agent frontmatter — `model:` set explicitly across all 6 fakoli-state agents (was `opus` uniformly; now `opus` for reasoning/synthesis, `sonnet` for structured generation, `haiku` for mechanical/read-only):
  - `planner` → opus | `critic` → opus | `docs-scribe` → sonnet | `marketplace-scribe` → sonnet | `sentinel` → haiku | `state-keeper` → haiku
- `config.yaml` template — gains commented `llm_*`, `bedrock_*`, `custom_*` blocks with tier-mapping reference so new projects see the multi-provider shape at init time.

### Fixed

- `cli/plan._resolve_llm_provider()` previously hardcoded an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env check, diverging from the resolver's own logic and forcing users on Bedrock or custom endpoints to skip `--use-llm` entirely even when their non-Anthropic provider was correctly configured. Now both paths share the resolver.

### Fixed

- **greptile MUST FIX #1.** `_choose_provider_family` was using `hasattr(anthropic, "AnthropicBedrock")` to detect whether the Bedrock extras were installed. The `AnthropicBedrock` class ships with the base `anthropic` install — only `boto3` (the transitive dep added by the `[bedrock]` extra) actually gates it. Switched to `try: import boto3` so AWS_REGION-set boxes without the extras correctly fall through to "no provider available" instead of picking Bedrock and crashing at construction.
- **greptile MUST FIX #2 + critic MUST FIX #1.** When the operator pinned `llm_provider: bedrock` (or `custom`) in config without installing the extras, the underlying `LLMProviderError` propagated past the resolver's `PlannerProviderUnavailable` contract — users saw a raw traceback where curated help text was promised. The resolver now wraps every per-family `_build_*` call's `LLMProviderError` into `PlannerProviderUnavailable` with an install-command suggestion.
- **critic MUST FIX #2.** `_build_custom` silently defaulted to `claude-sonnet-4-6` when the operator had `llm_provider: custom` but no `llm_model` / `llm_tier`. On a local vLLM serving Mistral-7B (or any non-Anthropic OpenRouter route) this produced a confusing "model not found" failure that looked like a network issue. The resolver now refuses to invent a model and raises `PlannerProviderUnavailable` with an actionable message naming the config keys.
- **structure-critic MUST FIX.** `bin/src/fakoli_state/__init__.py` `__version__` was stale at `1.16.0` — every other source of truth had bumped to `1.17.0`. Now in sync, plus a new `tests/test_version_sync.py` regression that asserts `pyproject.toml`, `__init__.py`, and `plugin.json` agree at the start of every test run.

### Changed (post-review polish)

- `mcp_server.py` `plan_tasks` soft-load — narrowed the broad `except Exception` to `(FileNotFoundError, OSError, ValueError)` first, then a labeled last-resort guard for `yaml.YAMLError` and friends. Mirrors `cli/plan.py:_load_config_optional`'s pattern (mcp-critic SHOULD FIX).
- `cli/plan.py:_load_config_optional` — caught `yaml.YAMLError` explicitly; dropped the misleading "yaml.YAMLError is a subclass of yaml.YAMLError" comment (critic SHOULD FIX #3).
- `cli/plan.py` — removed unused `os` and `re` imports left over from the refactor (critic SHOULD FIX #6).
- `mcp_server.PlanTasksResponse.llm_provider` field comment and `plan_tasks` docstring — updated to document the v1.17.0 multi-provider story (`anthropic` / `bedrock` / `custom` rather than the stale "anthropic today, claude-agent-sdk reserved for v1.16+"); added a note that the MCP server inherits env from the host process (mcp-critic SHOULD FIX).
- `bin/pyproject.toml` `keywords` — synced with `plugin.json` keywords (was drifted: 10 keys differ pre-PR). Cosmetic alignment for marketplace search (structure-critic SHOULD FIX).
- `fakoli-plugin-critic` agent files — sed sweep of "fakoli-crew critic severity rubric" → "fakoli-plugin-critic severity rubric" and similar namespace-stale prose left over from the extraction. Agent system prompts now read as part of `fakoli-plugin-critic`, not `fakoli-crew` (structure-critic SHOULD FIX #4).
- `fakoli-plugin-critic/README.md` — added standard shields.io badges (license, version, marketplace) to match sibling plugins; install snippet shows the `marketplace add` prerequisite (structure-critic SHOULD FIX #5, #10).
- `fakoli-plugin-critic/CHANGELOG.md` — added an `_No unreleased changes._` placeholder under `[Unreleased]` (structure-critic CONSIDER #7).
- `fakoli-plugin-critic/docs/` — removed (was an empty directory).

### Tests

1103 passing (was 1083 baseline). Diff: +20 net (8 new `TestResolvePlannerProvider` + 3 `TestResolveModelForTier` + 2 `TestCustomEndpointProvider` + 4 `TestResolvePlannerProviderGreptileFixes` (greptile + critic regression) + 4 `TestBedrockProvider` (closes the BedrockProvider test gap critic SHOULD FIX #8 flagged) + 2 `test_version_sync.py` (structure-critic regression); 4 existing tests updated for the new resolver signature and the MUST FIX #2 contract change.

## [1.16.0] — 2026-05-26

Single-bug release driven by in-the-wild testing: the planner missed an
obvious task→task dependency. T002 (chaos tests in 2-process mode)
clearly depended on T001 (HttpTransport implementation) — without T001
the 2-process mode the tests need doesn't exist — but the generated
task graph showed `dependencies=[]` for T002, and the user only caught
it by reading the PRD acceptance criteria during claim.

Root cause was a three-layer gap:

1. **Parser** (`planning/template.py`) didn't recognise a
   `**Dependencies:** T001, T002` field in task blocks. Even if the
   PRD author wrote it explicitly, the parser silently dropped it.
2. **LLM planner prompt** (`planning/llm_planner.py`) didn't instruct
   the model to identify dependencies from acceptance criteria text.
   The model had no example to emit and no rule telling it to look.
3. **Only existing dep inference** (`planning/inference.py`
   `infer_dependencies`) was a file-subset heuristic — purely
   file-based. It would NEVER catch "T002 needs T001 because the
   criteria say 'in 2-process mode'" if the tests lived in
   `tests/chaos/` while the implementation lived in
   `packages/transport/` (no file overlap).

v1.16.0 closes all three.

### Added

- **Parser support for `**Dependencies:**` field** in task blocks
  (`planning/template.py`). Comma-separated TaskIDs, normalised to
  upper-case (`t001, T002` → `["T001", "T002"]`). Post-parse
  validation surfaces a `ParseError` warning when a dependency
  references a task ID that doesn't exist in the same `## Tasks`
  section — the dep is kept on the task regardless so downstream
  tooling can see the author's intent.
- **LLM planner prompt instructions for dependency emission**
  (`planning/llm_planner.py`). The system prompt now includes
  `**Dependencies:**` in the example task block AND a "Dependencies
  (CRITICAL — read carefully)" rule block explaining the two
  trigger conditions:
  - **Infrastructure dependency** — Task A creates infrastructure
    (API, service, transport, schema, CLI command) that Task B
    needs.
  - **Phrasal dependency in acceptance criteria** — "in X mode",
    "using Y", "after Z is complete", "given W from <other task>".
  Plus an explicit cycle-avoidance rule and an instruction to OMIT
  the field entirely when no deps exist (no empty `**Dependencies:**`
  lines).
- **`fakoli-state claim` warns on undone dependencies (soft gate)**.
  Before acquiring the lease, claim fetches `task.dependencies` and
  checks each one's status. If any are not yet `done`, emits a
  stderr warning naming each dep + status, then proceeds with the
  claim. `--force` silences the warning. The soft-gate design
  preserves legitimate stacked-PR workflows (claim T002 while T001
  is still in_progress and merge them together) while ensuring the
  user knows what they're doing.
- **10 new regression tests:**
  - 4 in `tests/test_template.py::TestTaskParsing`: explicit deps
    field parses, multi-value normalises uppercase, unknown ID
    warns, omitted field defaults to empty.
  - 4 in `tests/test_llm_planner.py::TestSystemPromptInstructsDependencyEmission`:
    prompt shows the field, prompt names the two triggers, prompt
    says omit-when-empty, prompt warns against cycles.
  - 2 in `tests/test_cli.py::TestClaimCommand`: claim warns on
    undone deps; `--force` silences the warning.

### Changed

- README badges updated for v1.16.0: tests 1071 → 1081 (+10);
  version 1.15.0 → 1.16.0.
- `docs/prd-template.md` task-field reference table gains a
  `**Dependencies:**` row, the canonical-example T003 demonstrates
  using it (`**Dependencies:** T001, T002`), and a paragraph
  explains when to emit the field vs leave it to file-overlap
  conflict groups.

### Migration

No breaking changes. Schema unchanged. The `Task.dependencies` field
already existed in the Pydantic model since pre-v1.0 — v1.16.0 just
wires it through the parser, the planner prompt, and the claim
gate. PRDs without `**Dependencies:**` fields continue to work
unchanged (the field is optional, defaults to empty list). The
existing file-subset `infer_dependencies()` still runs after parse
— v1.16.0 layers explicit semantic deps on top of, not in place of,
the file-based inference.

The claim warning is soft (proceeds with the claim) so existing CI /
scripts that call `claim` won't suddenly start failing. Users who
prefer stricter behaviour can wrap the warning in their own
project's git-pre-push hook or check `fakoli-state show TASK_ID`
before claiming.

### Fixed (post-greptile review)

- **Dependency ParseError now points at the offending `### Txxx:`
  block**, not at the `## Tasks` section header. The parser tracks
  a `task_id → block_line` map during the parse loop and consults
  it during post-loop validation. Before the fix, a user with a
  bad `**Dependencies:** T099` on T002 would be pointed at line 1
  of the section instead of T002's heading.
- **Self-dependency now stripped + warned** instead of passing
  silently. A task with `**Dependencies:** T001` on T001 would
  otherwise trigger a perpetual claim-time warning (T001 can never
  be `done` before it is claimed). The parser strips the self-ref
  AND emits a clear "remove yourself from your own dependencies"
  warning naming the offending task. Note this differs from the
  unknown-ID handling, which KEEPS the bad ID so downstream tooling
  can see the author's intent — self-refs are unambiguously wrong.
- **`--force` help text updated** to mention that the flag silences
  both file-conflict warnings AND dependency warnings. Previously
  only the file-conflict half was documented, so users wouldn't
  know `--force` cleared the dep-warning noise too.
- Suite is **1083 passing** (+2 regression tests for self-dep
  stripping and per-block line attribution).

## [1.15.0] — 2026-05-26

Five-bug release driven by in-the-wild testing on a real project. Every
bug shares the same anti-pattern at progressively deeper layers: **the
agent silently failed or asked the user to make a routing/typing
decision the agent had the context to make**. v1.15.0 closes all five.

What changed in this release:

1. **`fakoli-state plan` GUARANTEES task generation** — calls the LLM
   automatically when the PRD has features + requirements but no
   `## Tasks` section. The user no longer has to remember to dispatch
   the `fakoli-state:planner` subagent as a workaround.
2. **`fakoli-state plan` PRUNES ORPHAN tasks/features on re-parse** —
   the docs always claimed "Re-parse replaces, not merges" but the
   implementation only upserted by ID. New `task.deleted` /
   `feature.deleted` event types with safety guards land the
   re-parse contract.
3. **`fakoli-state expand --use-llm` tolerates fenced JSON + prose** —
   previously every call failed with `Expecting value: line 1 column
   1 (char 0)` because the parser couldn't handle the markdown
   fences Claude routinely wraps JSON in.
4. **`branch_prefix` is host-project-configurable** — host projects
   with `feature/` / `fix/` conventions no longer get silently-
   incompatible `agent/` branches.
5. **`execute` skill auto-dispatches to fakoli-crew** — instead of
   asking the user "how would you like to proceed?" the skill
   encodes a routing heuristic that picks the right specialist
   from the task's signals (likely_files, verb, criteria).

Suite is **1071 passing** (was 1024 in v1.14.0; +47 new tests across
the LLM planner module, orphan-cleanup handlers, fenced-JSON parser,
`branch_prefix` validation, and CLI/MCP integration). Schema
unchanged. No breaking changes for existing callers, with one
behaviour-change callout in **Migration** below.

### Added

- **New `planning/llm_planner.py` module** with `generate_tasks_markdown()`
  and `resolve_planner_provider()`. Pure module; emits `## Tasks`
  markdown that the existing `planning.template.parse_prd` consumes
  via round-trip. Tier-chain provider resolver (see "Provider
  tier-chain design" below). 15 unit tests covering tier resolution,
  prompt assembly, output validation, and end-to-end with a recorded
  LLM provider.
- **`fakoli-state plan` LLM backstop (CLI).** When the deterministic
  parse yields 0 tasks but ≥1 features, the CLI calls
  `generate_tasks_markdown()`, idempotently appends the `## Tasks`
  block to `prd.md` (re-runs are no-ops once the section exists),
  re-reads + re-parses, emits `task.created` events. The output
  line explicitly tells the user the file was modified.
- **New `--no-llm` flag on `plan` CLI.** Opts out of auto-generation
  (e.g. on CI without API keys). When passed and 0 tasks are parsed,
  CLI exits 1 with a clear "author them manually" message — never
  silently returns 0.
- **MCP `plan_tasks` mirrors the CLI.** New `use_llm: bool = True`
  and `prune_force: bool = False` parameters. Response model gains
  `llm_generated`, `llm_provider`, `pruned_task_ids`,
  `pruned_feature_ids` fields (all with defaults so old clients see
  no breaking change). `PlannerProviderUnavailable` and
  `TaskGenerationError` raise `ToolError` with safe summaries — no
  silent 0-task responses, no LLM-output leakage in error messages.
- **New `task.deleted` and `feature.deleted` event types** with
  handlers in `state/sqlite.py`. The schema's
  `tasks.parent_task_id ON DELETE SET NULL` and
  `sync_mappings.task_id ON DELETE CASCADE` were designed for
  deletion from the start (see `state/schema.py:40` comment); v1.15.0
  finally wires the events. Safety: `task.deleted` refuses non-safe
  statuses (claimed, in_progress, needs_review, etc.) unless
  `force=True`, AND refuses unconditionally when claims or evidence
  rows still reference the task (FK-protected audit history that
  not even `--prune-force` overrides). `feature.deleted` refuses if
  tasks still reference the feature (FK RESTRICT pre-check).
- **`fakoli-state plan` auto-prunes orphans on re-parse.** Computes
  the diff between `state.db` and the new parse, emits the deletion
  events. Safe-status orphans prune silently; unsafe-status orphans
  cause exit 1 with a blocked-IDs list and the `--prune-force`
  escape hatch. Output line surfaces what was pruned.
- **`Backend.list_features()` Protocol method + SQLite impl** —
  orphan detection needs the full feature set for the diff.
- **New `branch_prefix` field in `.fakoli-state/config.yaml`**
  (default `"agent"`, preserving pre-v1.15.0 behaviour). The CLI's
  `claim` command reads this and creates branches as
  `<branch_prefix>/<task-id>-<slug>` — set `branch_prefix: feature`
  and `claim` produces `feature/t012-...` instead of the
  silently-incompatible `agent/t012-...`. Nested prefixes
  (`feature/agent`) preserved verbatim. Empty string (`""`) is
  explicit no-prefix mode. Validation at config-load time:
  leading/trailing slashes, whitespace, non-string → `ValueError`
  with a clear message.
- **`create_branch_for_task` `branch_prefix=` keyword arg** (default
  `"agent"` for backwards compat). Pre-v1.15.0 callers see no change.
- **`config.yaml` template** (`write_default_config`) now emits the
  `branch_prefix:` line with inline guidance so fresh projects
  see the choice at init time.
- **Shared helpers module `planning/_plan_helpers.py`** consolidates
  the `_has_tasks_section` regex, `SAFE_DELETE_STATUSES` constant,
  `classify_orphans()`, and `emit_prune_events()`. Both CLI and MCP
  import from here instead of carrying twin copies (post-review
  consolidation — see Fixed below).
- **47 new regression tests** across:
  - `tests/test_llm_planner.py` (NEW, 15 tests): tier resolution,
    prompt assembly, fence-stripping, round-trip parse contract
  - `tests/test_llm_integration.py::TestExpandTaskHandlesLlmQuirks`
    (5 tests): fenced JSON, prose preamble, empty response, garbage
  - `tests/test_cli.py` (7 tests): `TestPlanLlmBackstop` +
    `TestPlanOrphanPrune` (CLI integration)
  - `tests/test_mcp.py` (6 tests): MCP integration mirrors
  - `tests/test_config.py` + `tests/test_git_ops.py` (13 tests):
    `branch_prefix` validation and end-to-end
  - +1 sanity test added during post-review CHANGELOG consolidation

### Changed

- **`plan` skill Step 1 rewritten.** The pre-v1.15.0 "if 0 tasks,
  dispatch the planner subagent" workaround is gone — the CLI now
  guarantees tasks, so the skill just runs `plan` and surfaces the
  result. Agent MUST surface `(N generated via LLM ...)` output to
  the user so they know `prd.md` was modified.
- **`plan` skill new Step 1.5 — structured Q&A for post-plan
  decisions.** Scope overruns, structural concerns, expansion
  candidates each become a one-turn `AskUserQuestion` (in Claude
  Code) or numbered prompt elsewhere. **One decision per turn —
  do NOT batch.** Bolded as the leading sentence per skill-critic
  review.
- **`execute` skill Step 3 rewritten — auto-routes to fakoli-crew
  specialist.** First-match-wins routing table maps task signals to
  crew members (smith/guido/welder/scout/herald/keeper/sentinel/
  flow-execute). Tie-break rule disambiguates when two rows match
  (per skill-critic review). Step split into Step 3 (routing) +
  Step 3a (implementation discipline). Anti-pattern callout names
  the "How would you like to proceed?" failure mode.
- **`finish` skill new "Decision-presentation discipline" subsection.**
  Generalizes the v1.13.0 disposition-gate pattern (accept / reject /
  hold / discard) from a one-off to a rule: any 2+ option decision
  uses `AskUserQuestion` or explicit numbered prompts, never
  prose-with-bullets.
- **`claim` skill anti-pattern subsection extended** with the same
  Q&A discipline rule for claim-time decisions.
- **`prd` skill `## Iterating` section** clarified — the
  destructive-re-parse contract now reads as two distinct bullets
  (`prd parse` replaces requirements; `plan` prunes orphan
  features/tasks) so readers cannot conflate which command does
  which prune (per skill-critic review).
- README badges + "What ships today" + Architecture table updated
  for v1.15.0: version 1.14.0 → 1.15.0; test count 1024 → 1071;
  CLI commands 23 (was previously claimed as 24, but disk shows 23
  — corrected per structure-critic review); MCP tools 22 (the
  pre-v1.13.0 "13 tools" prose was stale in three places).
- README "Highlights from v1.10.0" section replaced with v1.15.0
  highlights — the previous block was 5 releases stale.

### Fixed

- **`expand --use-llm` was failing for every task** because
  `planning.inference._parse_subtask_response` called `json.loads`
  with no tolerance for markdown fences. Modern Claude models
  routinely wrap JSON in ` ```json … ``` ` despite the prompt. The
  parser saw the leading backtick instead of `[` and emitted
  `Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`. Three-layer fix:
  strip fences (` ```json `, ` ```jsonl `, plain ` ``` `) →
  fall back to string-aware bracket-matching extractor for
  `Here are 3 sub-tasks: [...]` shapes → warning now includes a
  300-char sample of the response so debugging doesn't require
  extra verbosity. System prompt strengthened in parallel.
- **CLI `plan` orphan-deletion loops now catch `TransactionAborted`**
  (post-greptile fix). Previously the MCP path caught and re-raised
  as `ToolError`, but the CLI emitted the raw Python traceback —
  most accessible trigger was "user removes a feature heading from
  prd.md while keeping its referencing tasks." Now CLI surfaces the
  handler's clear message via `typer.echo` + `Exit(1)`.
- **CLI/MCP duplication consolidated** (post-critic fix). The
  `_has_tasks_section` helper, `SAFE_DELETE_STATUSES` constant
  (previously triplicated across `cli/plan.py`, `mcp_server.py`,
  and `state/sqlite.py`), and the orphan-prune emit loops (~90
  duplicated lines) now live in `planning/_plan_helpers.py` and
  both layers import from there. Future changes to safe-statuses
  no longer require three synchronized edits.
- **`cli/claim.py` no longer silently swallows config-load errors**
  (post-critic fix — "exactly the bug class this PR is supposed to
  fix"). A YAML typo in `branch_prefix: feature` now emits a stderr
  warning naming the failure before falling back to the default,
  instead of silently producing an `agent/...` branch the user
  thought they had configured away.
- **`planning/llm_planner.py` prompt-injection defense**
  (post-critic fix). User PRD text (summary, goals, requirements,
  features) now wraps in a `<prd>...</prd>` XML fence and the
  system prompt instructs the model to treat anything inside as
  data, not instructions. PRDs are author-controlled so practical
  risk is low; this is defense-in-depth.
- **`mcp_server.py` `TaskGenerationError` safe summary**
  (post-mcp-critic fix). The exception's message can include up
  to 500 chars of raw LLM output; re-raising via `ToolError`
  leaked that to MCP clients. Full exception logged to stderr;
  client sees a safe, actionable summary.
- **`state/sqlite.py` `_handle_task_deleted` conflict_groups
  cleanup** (post-critic fix). Malformed `task_ids` JSON in a
  conflict_group row was silently `continue`'d, leaving the
  deleted task ID reachable from subsequent queries. Now logs the
  corruption to stderr AND resets the malformed row to `"[]"` so
  state.db ends consistent. Tuple-unpack of cursor rows replaced
  with explicit `row["id"]` / `row["task_ids"]` access via the
  `sqlite3.Row` row factory.

### Migration

**No breaking changes for existing callers.** Schema unchanged. All
23 CLI commands and 22 MCP tools continue to work; the new fields
on `PlanTasksResponse` have defaults so old clients see no surprises.
New CLI flags (`--no-llm`, `--prune-force`) and MCP parameters
(`use_llm`, `prune_force`) are opt-in.

**One behaviour callout for MCP and CLI callers (post-mcp-critic
review).** Pre-1.15.0 callers of `plan_tasks` / `fakoli-state plan`
on a PRD with features + requirements but no `## Tasks` section
previously got `task_count=0` and unchanged `prd.md`. As of v1.15.0
the default behaviour is to **call the LLM and rewrite `prd.md`** —
the file gets a fresh `## Tasks` section appended. Pass
`use_llm=False` (MCP) or `--no-llm` (CLI) to preserve the
pre-1.15.0 "task_count=0, file untouched" behaviour. The CLI
output line and the new MCP response fields explicitly surface
when the file was modified.

The `fakoli-state:planner` agent file (`agents/planner.md`) is
unchanged. It remains useful as a reference and for explicit-
dispatch use cases that need the subagent's structured-output
discipline (PRD critique, expansion proposals, incremental
planning across PRD revisions).

### Provider tier-chain design

`resolve_planner_provider()` walks an ordered chain:

1. **Tier 1 — claude-agent-sdk** (RESERVED for v1.16+). Currently
   falls through silently. Hook is in place so a future PR can land
   the wrapper without touching callers. Deferred because the SDK
   is async, requires Node.js + Claude Code CLI installed system-
   wide, and Claude Code's environment already exposes
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — so Tier 2 covers the same use case at zero
   extra setup cost today.
2. **Tier 2 — anthropic SDK with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** (CURRENT).
   Direct Anthropic API call via the existing `AnthropicProvider`.
   Used in both standalone and Claude Code contexts.
3. **Tier 3 — fail loudly** with a multi-line message naming both
   the env var path and the future SDK path. Never returns 0 tasks
   silently.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-05-26

Generalizes v1.13.0's "drive interactively" principle one layer deeper:
when the PRD has `[NEEDS DECISION]` markers, unresolved `## Open Questions`,
or task-level missing fields (empty acceptance criteria, missing
verification), the agent now drives each one as a one-question
conversational turn with proposed options — instead of telling the
user "open the editor and fix these first." An LLM agent's strength
over a CLI is exactly this: turning *blocked on a decision* into
*let me ask you the right question*.

### Added

- **New `planning/decisions.py` module** with `find_unresolved_decisions`
  function. Scans both raw markdown (for inline `[NEEDS DECISION]`
  markers — case-sensitive bracket-enclosed; HTML comments stripped
  to avoid false positives on draft notes) and parsed PRD/Tasks
  (for `## Open Questions` items and missing acceptance criteria /
  verification commands). Returns a flat ordered list of
  `UnresolvedDecision` records. Pure module — no I/O, no backend.
  18 unit tests in `tests/test_decisions.py`.
- **New CLI subcommand `fakoli-state prd find-decisions`** that prints
  a structured per-kind summary with id, location, text, surrounding
  context paragraph, and suggested resolution field. Exits 0
  regardless of finding count (it's a read-only inspection command).
  4 new tests in `tests/test_cli.py`.
- **New MCP tool `find_decisions(cwd)`** mirroring the CLI with a
  typed `FindDecisionsResponse` model. Total MCP surface 21 → 22.
  6 new tests in `tests/test_mcp.py`.
- **New `resolve-decisions` skill** (`skills/resolve-decisions/SKILL.md`).
  Drives each unresolved item as one Q&A turn with proposed options
  when the surrounding context allows. Applies answers to `prd.md`
  inline: `[NEEDS DECISION]` markers get rewritten in place; resolved
  Open Questions get moved to a new `## Decisions` section that
  preserves the audit trail (what was unclear at draft time + what
  was decided + when); missing-field decisions edit the relevant
  `### TXXX:` block to add the chosen acceptance criteria or
  verification commands. Re-parses on completion. Total skills 7 → 8.
- **Soft gates** wired into `prd` skill (Step 2 — after parse) and
  `plan` skill (new Step 0 — before plan_tasks). When
  `find_decisions` returns non-empty, the agent surfaces the summary
  and asks "resolve now via the resolve-decisions skill, or proceed
  without resolving?" The gate is soft by design: Open Questions
  are informational and don't block review/approval; the agent
  surfaces the cost of proceeding and lets the user pick the cadence.

### Changed

- README badges and "What ships today" table updated for v1.14.0:
  version 1.13.0 → 1.14.0; tests 994 → 1022 (+28 new across
  decisions/CLI/MCP); CLI commands 23 → 24; MCP tools 21 → 22;
  skills 7 → 8.

### Migration

No breaking changes. Schema unchanged. The 21 existing MCP tools and
23 existing CLI commands are unchanged. The skill rewrites only add
soft-gate prose; they do not change the user-visible behavior of
`prd review` or `plan` for clean PRDs (find_decisions returns empty,
the gate skips). Existing PRDs that have always-clean (no markers,
no Open Questions, no missing fields) see no change at all.

### Detection scope details

- **`[NEEDS DECISION]` marker:** case-sensitive, bracket-enclosed,
  optional `: <question>` payload (e.g.
  `[NEEDS DECISION: which encoding?]`). Markers inside HTML comments
  (`<!-- [NEEDS DECISION: ...] -->`) are intentionally ignored so
  drafts can carry TODO-style notes without triggering the resolver.
  Fuzzy prose like "needs decision on the auth flow" inside a
  paragraph does NOT trigger detection — the marker is the explicit
  contract.
- **`## Open Questions`:** explicit "none identified" / "none" /
  "n/a" / "tbd" bullets are recognized as placeholders and skipped.
  This preserves the v1.10.0 convention of declaring "no open
  questions" with an explicit bullet instead of an empty section.
- **Missing fields:** only `task.acceptance_criteria` and
  `task.verification.commands` are checked. Empty requirements text
  and empty feature descriptions are reserved for v1.15+ (the
  detection module accepts `requirements=` and `features=`
  parameters now to avoid a signature break later).

### Fixed (post-greptile review)

- **OQ IDs are now contiguous after placeholder skipping.** Previously
  the counter advanced for every Open Questions item including
  `"none identified"` / `"n/a"` / `"tbd"` placeholders, so a PRD with
  `[placeholder, real, placeholder, real]` produced `OQ002` + `OQ004`
  instead of `OQ001` + `OQ002`. Non-contiguous IDs would confuse the
  resolver skill (which iterates decisions sequentially). The
  contiguous-ID counter only advances for items that survive the
  placeholder filter; the `location` field still carries the source
  position so users can find the item in the file.
- **MCP `find_decisions` now matches the CLI on parse failures.**
  Previously the MCP tool silently proceeded when `parse_prd` returned
  errors, yielding a deceptive `0 open_questions` count even though
  the PRD was malformed. Now it raises `ToolError` with the first
  few errors summarised in the message, matching the CLI's exit-1
  behaviour so MCP clients see the parse failure before drawing
  conclusions from the decision list.
- Test suite is **1024 passing** (was 1022 — +1 regression test for
  the OQ contiguous-ID fix, +1 for the MCP parse-failure fix).

## [1.13.0] — 2026-05-26

Two-axis release driven by a single user observation: agents using
fakoli-state were ending every workflow with a CLI to-do list ("1. Run
`prd parse`, 2. Run `prd review`, 3. Run `prd review --approve`,
4. Run `plan`, …") instead of driving the workflow inline. The
handoff pattern only makes sense when work is leaving the session
entirely; with one agent and one user in the same conversation, the
agent should drive each command, surface its output, and present the
next decision. The fix is at the skill layer (so every future session
inherits it) AND at the MCP layer (so non-shell MCP clients can drive
the full workflow without dropping to a Bash tool they may not have).

### Changed

- **Skills now drive the workflow interactively.** `start-prd`, `prd`,
  `plan`, `claim`, and `finish` rewrote their interactive sections to
  encode "agent runs each state-engine command itself; surfaces the
  output inline; asks the user the next decision; runs the next
  command on the user's word." The closing-with-a-CLI-to-do-list
  pattern is explicitly named as an anti-pattern in each of these
  skills. The two approval gates (`prd review --approve` and
  `apply --approve`) are the only hard handoffs, and even at those
  the agent asks "ready? yes/no" and runs the command on confirmation
  — it does not paste the command for the user to type. An explicit
  escape hatch is preserved: when the user says "just give me the
  commands," or when the runtime has no execution tool, the CLI list
  output is correct.
- README test-count badge 975 → 993; version badges 1.12.1 → 1.13.0.

### Added

- **8 new MCP tools** so the full PRD → plan → review → approve →
  claim → submit → apply workflow is drivable from any MCP client
  without a Bash tool: `init_project`, `get_project_status`,
  `parse_prd`, `review_prd`, `plan_tasks`, `score_tasks`,
  `review_tasks`, `apply_review_decision`. Total MCP surface is now
  21 tools (was 13). All new tools call the same shared modules the
  CLI calls — no logic duplication. Structured response models
  return well-shaped data; operational failures (missing file,
  uninitialized project) raise `ToolError` with a clear message,
  parse-level errors are returned as data so callers can inspect-
  and-retry without exception handling.
- **19 new MCP regression tests** in `tests/test_mcp.py` covering
  happy and error paths for each new tool, including a regression
  test for the `plan_tasks` ordering guard (must run `parse_prd`
  first or fail loudly). Suite is 994 passing (was 975 in v1.12.1).

### Fixed (post-greptile review)

- **`plan_tasks` no longer mutates state when called out of order.**
  Previously, calling `plan_tasks` before `parse_prd` would emit
  `feature.created` and `task.created` events into a backend with
  no PRD row — leaving `review_prd` and `apply_review_decision` to
  fail later with "No PRD found in state" after the state was
  already partially mutated. The tool now verifies `backend.get_prd()`
  returns a row before emitting any events and raises `ToolError`
  with a clear "call parse_prd first" message if not.
- **`init_project` resource cleanup hardened.** `backend.initialize()`
  was being called outside the `try/finally` block, so a failure
  during schema bootstrap would leak the backend connection. Moved
  inside the try so `backend.close()` always runs.
- **`score_tasks` docstring clarified** to match the CLI's intentional
  behavior: an explicit `task_id` always re-scores (whether or not
  scores are complete); omitting `task_id` only scores tasks whose
  Score is incomplete. The asymmetry is deliberate and matches
  `fakoli-state score [TASK_ID]`.
- New "Workflow tools (v1.13.0)" section in `docs/mcp.md`,
  organized by lifecycle phase (Bootstrap → PRD → Planning → Review)
  with parameters, returns, examples, and CLI equivalents for each
  new tool.

### Migration

No breaking changes. The 13 existing MCP tools, all 23 CLI commands,
and the on-disk state schema are unchanged. The skill rewrites
change the agent's interactive behavior only — any CLI script,
hook, or pre-existing workflow that invokes `fakoli-state` commands
directly continues to work identically. Plugins that wrap fakoli-state
(`fakoli-flow`, `fakoli-crew`) are unaffected.

### Notes on `init_project` and helper extraction

The MCP `init_project` tool inlines a small amount of project-seeding
logic that today lives privately inside `cli/init_status.py`
(`_apply_init_event`). A future cleanup could lift that helper into
`state/init.py` so MCP and CLI share a single source. Flagged in the
codebase; not blocking for v1.13.0. Similarly `_PRD_FILENAME` is
duplicated between `cli/_helpers.py` and `mcp_server.py` to avoid
pulling typer into the MCP import graph — worth promoting to a
shared constants module someday.

---

## [1.12.1] — 2026-05-26

Bug-fix release for a silent-drop in the PRD parser. Reported by a user
running fakoli-state in another project: an agent authored a PRD with
`## Features` written as bullets (instead of `### F001:` H3 blocks) and
`fakoli-state prd parse` reported "0 features, 0 tasks" before exiting
0. The agent's work was invisibly discarded.

### Fixed

- `_parse_features` and `_parse_tasks` in
  `bin/src/fakoli_state/planning/template.py` now emit a `ParseError`
  when their section body has non-empty / non-comment content but
  produces zero `### Fxxx:` / `### Txxx:` H3 blocks. The error message
  names the canonical format and points to `docs/prd-template.md`. This
  matches the parser's own documented contract ("Silent fallback is
  explicitly rejected") — previously both functions returned `[]`
  silently when the format was wrong, in violation of that contract.
  CLI behavior unchanged: any `ParseError` causes `prd parse` to exit
  non-zero before writing to `state.db`, so no malformed data ever
  reaches state.
- `_parse_features` and `_parse_tasks` now also warn when an H3 heading
  looks like an attempted custom ID (e.g. `### F-DURABILITY: foo`,
  `### T-1: foo`) but does not match the required `Fxxx` / `Txxx`
  format (letter + 3+ digits). Previously the parser silently auto-
  assigned a default ID and the user had no way to know their custom
  ID had been discarded. Conservative detection (only F/T + a
  separator like `-`, `_`, `.`) so legitimate auto-ID fallbacks for
  English headings like `### My Feature` keep working unchanged.
- An empty `## Features` or `## Tasks` section header (no body at all)
  still parses cleanly with no error, preserving the existing escape
  hatch for "section declared but no items yet".

### Added

- Eight regression tests in `tests/test_template.py`: four
  `features` variants (`bullets_only`, `prose_only`,
  `empty_section`, `malformed_id_prefix`) and four parallel `tasks`
  variants. Suite now 975 passing (was 967).

### Changed

- README test-count badge 967 → 975; version badges 1.12.0 → 1.12.1.
- The malformed-ID warning messages in `_parse_features` and
  `_parse_tasks` were reworded to be unambiguous: the previous "an ID
  was auto-assigned" phrasing described an internal fallback the user
  never sees (because the ParseError blocks persistence), which read
  as if the parse had succeeded. The new wording names the format
  violation and tells the user to rename the heading to
  `### F001:` / `### T001:` and re-run.

---

## [1.12.0] — 2026-05-26

Skill rename to resolve the `brainstorm` namespace collision with
`fakoli-flow:brainstorm`. The fakoli-state skill that drafts a PRD from
a rough idea is now `start-prd` — slug, slash command, and every
cross-reference updated. The skill router can now route "let's
brainstorm" cleanly to `fakoli-flow` and "start a PRD" cleanly to
fakoli-state. Markdown-choreography only; no Python source, schema, or
test changes (967 tests still passing).

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `/fakoli-state:brainstorm` skill renamed to
  `/fakoli-state:start-prd`. Directory (`skills/brainstorm/` →
  `skills/start-prd/`), frontmatter `name:`, slash-command form, and
  every cross-reference in README, `architecture.md`,
  `skills-reference.md`, `how-to/integrating-with-fakoli-flow-and-crew.md`,
  `skills/prd/SKILL.md`, `roadmap.md`, `phase-11-backlog.md`, and the
  v0 spec updated. Skill description rewritten to remove "brainstorm"
  as a trigger word and add concrete trigger phrases ("start a PRD",
  "draft requirements", "author a PRD", "spec out a project"). Bridge
  to `/fakoli-flow:brainstorm` (the OTHER plugin's skill, unrelated to
  this rename) is unchanged and still fires when fakoli-flow is
  installed.
- Marketing copy updated to drop "brainstorms" in favor of "rough
  ideas" — README hero, `_positioning.md` canonical (Q) sentence,
  `bin/pyproject.toml` description, CLI `--help` description, and the
  v0 spec. The vocabulary now matches the renamed skill instead of
  pulling the skill router back toward the colliding term.
- README badges refreshed: version 1.10.0 → 1.12.0; test count 965 → 967
  (catches up the v1.11.0 additions that did not update the badges).

### Migration

If your scripts, hooks, CI, agents, or muscle memory invoke
`/fakoli-state:brainstorm`, change to `/fakoli-state:start-prd`. No
state schema migration is required (still v3, unchanged since v1.8.0);
no CLI command was renamed (no `fakoli-state brainstorm` CLI command
ever shipped — only the skill); the rename is purely at the skill-
router layer.

### Notes on historical artifacts

The `docs/tech-debt-backlog.md` entry P9-5 and the
`docs/specs/2026-05-26-plugin-audit-and-critics.md` audit doc still
reference `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` — these are intentionally
unchanged. P9-5 documents a Phase 9 fix to the file at the path it had
AT THAT TIME; the audit doc is a frozen v1.9.0 snapshot. Rewriting
either would obscure audit traceability. Status files under
`docs/plans/agent-*-status.md` are similarly frozen.

### Versioning note

By strict SemVer this is a breaking change and would warrant 2.0.0.
The project reserves 2.0.0 for the inflection-point release planned
on `docs/roadmap.md` (sync v2, replay tooling, multi-backend sync
abstraction). This rename is shipped as 1.12.0 with an explicit
`BREAKING:` marker to keep the v2.0 slot intact.

---

## [1.11.0] — 2026-05-25

Comprehensive documentation overhaul + 3 silent-failure bug fixes surfaced
during research (missing fakoli-flow detection in `claim`/`execute` skills;
`submit` CLI hardcoding `screenshots=[]`; broken `grep -q "^fakoli-..."`
anchor pattern at 5 sites). No breaking changes; the `submit --screenshots`
flag is the only behavior change and is purely additive (optional).

### Added (docs)

- **Positioning + foundation:** `docs/_positioning.md` (internal reference),
  rewritten `README.md` with hero block / 5-wedge comparison / working v1.10.0
  Quick Start, `docs/architecture.md` (579 lines, 3 mermaid diagrams, 25-entity
  data model, replay guarantee), `docs/design.md` (301 lines, design rationale
  + Deferred decisions). [PR #54]
- **User-facing how-to (5 files):** `docs/how-to/getting-started.md`,
  `authoring-a-prd.md`, `claiming-and-shipping-a-task.md`,
  `syncing-with-github.md`, `integrating-with-fakoli-flow-and-crew.md`. [PR #55]
- **Reference (5 files):** `docs/cli-reference.md` (all 23 commands),
  `skills-reference.md` (7 skills + dependency graph),
  `agents-reference.md` (6 agents + defer-to-crew mapping),
  `hooks-reference.md` (4 hooks + non-blocking contract),
  `faq.md` (15 Q&A). [PR #55]
- **Visual brand:** `assets/logo-{64,256,1024}.png` generated via
  nano-banana-pro; `assets/diagrams/{component,lifecycle,trinity}.mmd`
  for re-render. [PR #54]
- **CLI flag:** `submit --screenshots PATH1,PATH2` for tasks whose
  `verification.required_evidence` includes "screenshots". 2 new tests. [PR #55]

### Fixed (silent-failure bugs)

- **`skills/claim/SKILL.md` + `skills/execute/SKILL.md` had no fakoli-flow
  detection snippet** — both used prose-only "when fakoli-flow is installed"
  framing with no shell check, so the bridge to `/fakoli-flow:execute`
  never fired even when the plugin was installed. Added Step 0 detection
  blocks mirroring `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`. [PR #55]
- **`submit` CLI hardcoded `screenshots=[]`** — Evidence model field,
  evidence_complete gate, and gate tests all existed; only the CLI surface
  was missing. Tasks requiring "screenshots" evidence were unsatisfiable.
  See `Added` above. [PR #55]
- **`grep -q "^fakoli-..."` detection pattern was broken at 5 sites** —
  real `claude plugin list` output starts with `  ❯ ` indent + `@source`
  suffix; `^` anchor never matched. Trinity composition silently never
  activated even when fakoli-flow + fakoli-crew were installed. Fixed in
  `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md`, `skills/finish/SKILL.md`, and 3 PR-B docs.
  Updated 5 roadmap entries (P11-SK-S1/S2/S3/S6) so future work uses the
  corrected pattern. [PR #55]
- **PR A doc drifts caught during PR B research:** `docs/architecture.md`
  default lease 15 → 60 min; `docs/mcp.md` `get_next_task` ranking corrected
  (priority desc → complexity asc → created_at asc, not agent_suitability);
  `agents/sentinel.md` frontmatter `allowed-tools:` → `tools:` (Phase 10
  audit leftover); `docs/design.md` + `docs/faq.md` config file pointer
  `settings.json` → `config.yaml`. [PR #55]

### Changed

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` description tightened from 192 → 131 chars;
  10 high-signal keywords (added `local-first`, `runtime-neutral`,
  `terraform-for-work`, `llm-work-packets`; dropped generic terms). [PR #54]
- Repo root `README.md`: added fakoli-state to "The Fakoli Ecosystem"
  trinity narrative; refreshed "Available Plugins" row (removed stale
  "Scaffolded; phases 2-8 in progress"). [This PR]

### Tests

- 967 passed (up from 965 in v1.10.0; +2 for the new `--screenshots` flag).
- 0 regressions.
- Manual scratch-dir verification of the getting-started.md Quick Start
  end-to-end (init → PRD → parse → review → approve → plan → score → claim
  → packet → submit → apply → done).

## [1.10.0] — 2026-05-26

Phase 10: first plugin-dev best-practices audit + 8 MUST FIX items closed
inline. fakoli-crew v2.2.0 ships 5 new cross-plugin specialist critic agents
(agent-critic, skill-critic, hook-critic, mcp-critic, structure-critic — see
`plugins/fakoli-crew/CHANGELOG.md` § 2.2.0); this release applies their first
audit pass against fakoli-state v1.9.0's surface area and closes every MUST
FIX they surfaced. 57 SHOULD FIX / CONSIDER / NIT items are deferred to
`docs/phase-11-backlog.md` with per-critic provenance preserved.

Audit doc: [`docs/audits/2026-05-26-plugin-audit.md`](docs/audits/2026-05-26-plugin-audit.md).
Phase plan: [`docs/plans/2026-05-26-phase-10-plugin-audit.md`](docs/plans/2026-05-26-phase-10-plugin-audit.md).

Ships v1.10.0.

### Fixed — MUST FIX items closed in this phase (8)

1. `agents/critic.md:26` — renamed `allowed-tools:` → `tools:` (the `allowed-tools:` key is the *command* frontmatter key; on agent files it is silently ignored and the agent loads with full unrestricted tool access, defeating the Iron Rule's least-privilege intent for the read-only reviewer). Found by agent-critic.
2. `agents/docs-scribe.md:67` — same `allowed-tools:` → `tools:` rename. Found by agent-critic.
3. `agents/marketplace-scribe.md:67` — same rename. Found by agent-critic.
4. `agents/planner.md:44` — same rename (highest-stakes occurrence: the Iron Rule explicitly forbids planner writes to `.fakoli-state/`, but the frontmatter that was supposed to enforce least-privilege was silently ignored). Found by agent-critic.
5. `agents/state-keeper.md:45` — same rename (highest blast-radius occurrence given agent proximity to git and state files). Found by agent-critic.
6. `skills/finish/SKILL.md:249-252` — removed dangling `/fakoli-state:sentinel` slash-command reference (sentinel is an agent surface, not a skill — there is no slash-command for it; the broken reference would 404 on invocation). Replaced with explicit `claude plugin list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^fakoli-crew"` shell gate plus prose explaining the agent-dispatch contract so the next Claude session cannot re-introduce the bug by pattern-matching. As a bonus closure (welder Fix #6), this also resolves what would have been P11-SK-S5 in the Phase 11 backlog ("Fuzzy detection for `fakoli-crew:sentinel` — no shell check") — reducing the deferred SHOULD FIX count from 25 to 24. Found by skill-critic.
7. `skills/prd/SKILL.md:57-59` — added overwrite-confirmation gate before `prd parse` mutates `state.db` rows. Mirrors the brainstorm/SKILL.md:162-176 exists-check + summary + `yes/no/save-as-backup` prompt; applied at two mutation points (the editor open in Step 1 and the re-parse during iteration) since the prd flow has two destructive entry points. Found by skill-critic.
8. `README.md:103` — Skills row claimed a `verify` skill that does NOT exist on disk (overpromise); rewrote the row to list the 7 real skills (brainstorm, prd, plan, claim, execute, finish, state-ops) and document that verification is delegated to `fakoli-flow:verify` and `fakoli-crew:sentinel`, so the reader understands *why* `verify` is absent. Found by structure-critic.

### Added — 5 new fakoli-crew critic agents (audit infrastructure)

fakoli-crew v2.2.0 (see its CHANGELOG) ships 5 new cross-plugin specialist
critic agents that this release was the first subject of:

- **agent-critic** (magenta) — reviews `<plugin>/agents/*.md` frontmatter (name/description/color/model/tools), color-collision detection, `<example>` count discipline, the `allowed-tools:` vs `tools:` antipattern, defer-to validity, and file-length proportionality.
- **skill-critic** (teal) — reviews `<plugin>/skills/*/SKILL.md` for frontmatter validity, one-question-at-a-time discipline, hard-gate presence on irreversible actions, decision-flow clarity, lazy-loading discipline, and the no-fuzzy-detection rule.
- **hook-critic** (gray) — reviews `<plugin>/hooks/*.sh` + `hooks.json` for shebang portability, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` usage, stdin handling, hot-path performance, idempotency, matcher specificity, and — critically — whether the script's error-handling style matches the plugin's declared hook contract (e.g., fakoli-state's non-blocking contract forbids `set -e`).
- **mcp-critic** (white) — reviews `.mcp.json` + MCP server source for schema validity, `@mcp.tool()` decoration discipline, typed parameter annotations, structured error returns, secret-leak risks, transport choice rationale, and actor-identification on mutating tools.
- **structure-critic** (brown) — reviews cross-plugin structure: `plugin.json` required fields, version sync across `plugin.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `__init__.py` / `marketplace.json` / `registry/index.json`, README surface tables vs actual filesystem counts, CHANGELOG Keep-a-Changelog discipline, and `[Unreleased]` hygiene after a tag.

Each critic ships with a known-bad fixture at `plugins/fakoli-crew/tests/fixtures/audit-targets/` and a manual-verification recipe at `plugins/fakoli-crew/tests/RECIPES.md`. Together they form the cross-plugin critic surface — fakoli-state was the first subject; future plugins (fakoli-flow, fakoli-speak, etc.) can run the same five-critic audit.

### Deferred — Phase 11 backlog

57 SHOULD FIX / CONSIDER / NIT items deferred (25 SHOULD FIX, 21 CONSIDER, 11 NIT) — full per-critic detail with file:line provenance, recommended actions, and cross-cutting themes (no-fuzzy-detection across skills, non-empty actor validation across MCP tools, hot-path perf budget on hook scripts, hook-contract documentation gap, phase-status table drift, composition duplication across doc/state agents, install-messaging drift in README + CHANGELOG) recorded in [`docs/phase-11-backlog.md`](docs/phase-11-backlog.md). The Phase 10 welder Fix #6 closed one SHOULD FIX item (P11-SK-S5, fuzzy detection for `fakoli-crew:sentinel`) as a bonus during the dangling-slash-command fix — `phase-11-backlog.md` marks that line `[CLOSED in Phase 10 Fix #6]`. Net deferred SHOULD FIX count is **24** (down from 25 at audit time).

### Documentation

- `docs/audits/2026-05-26-plugin-audit.md` (NEW) — consolidated audit with severity-sorted findings table, per-critic detail sections, and "Items applied this phase" annotations linking each MUST FIX to the welder fix that closed it.
- `docs/phase-11-backlog.md` (NEW) — Phase 11 work-tracking doc mirroring the format of `docs/phase-9-backlog.md`. Includes 7 cross-cutting themes and explicit Phase 11 planner notes.
- `docs/plans/2026-05-26-phase-10-plugin-audit.md` (NEW) — full 16-task / 9-wave execution plan for the audit + fix cycle.
- `docs/specs/2026-05-26-plugin-audit-and-critics.md` (NEW) — source spec for the 5 new critic agents.

### Tests

- 965 passing (unchanged from v1.9.0 — all 8 MUST FIX items were markdown/frontmatter edits; no Python code touched, no behaviour drift).

## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-25

Phase 9: audit honesty + multi-provider config + Phase 7 cleanup + two
new plugin-owned doc agents. The sync engine's audit stream is now
truthful — six dishonest `sync.pull.completed` emissions on
conflict-resolution branches that did not actually mutate local state
now correctly emit `sync.pull.deferred`. The `local_moved`-only pull
path bug-collapse (mapping was set to `in_sync` despite local being
ahead) is fixed to set `sync_state="local_ahead"` and emit a
`sync.push.deferred` hint. The `SyncAuditPayload` model is now a Pydantic
v2 discriminated union with `extra="forbid"` per action — field-vs-action
mismatches surface as `ValidationError` instead of being silently
accepted. A new opt-in `sync.providers` config key lets projects narrow
or fully opt out of provider iteration.

Phase 7 leftovers closed: `RecordedLLMProvider.record_key` now folds
`max_tokens` and `temperature` into the canonical hash (two recordings
under different tuning args no longer collide); brainstorm-skill
fakoli-flow detection uses an explicit `claude plugin list` check rather
than fuzzy prose; `fakoli-state expand --use-llm --format prd` emits
paste-ready markdown blocks matching `docs/prd-template.md` (with
`**Feature:**` and `**Priority:**` populated from the parent task).

Ships v1.9.0.

### Added — Audit honesty (T5)

- `bin/src/fakoli_state/cli/sync.py`:
  - Six deferred conflict-resolution branches (`local_wins_deferred`, `remote_wins_deferred`, `prompt_defaulted_to_local`, `prompt_chose_local`, `prompt_chose_remote`, `prompt_skipped`) now emit `sync.pull.deferred` instead of the prior `sync.pull.completed`. The JSONL is safe to grep for "did this task actually update?".
  - `local_moved`-only pull path (local Task ahead of `last_synced_at`, no remote movement) now sets `sync_state="local_ahead"` (was `in_sync` — wrong) and emits `sync.push.deferred` with `resolution="local_moved_no_push"`. Operators grep `events.jsonl` for the token to find tasks awaiting a follow-up `--push`.
  - `_resolve_conflict` signature: `-> bool` → `-> tuple[bool, bool, str]` = `(resolved, applied, resolution)`. Internal private function; no external caller impact.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/state/payloads.py`:
  - 13 new per-action Pydantic v2 subclasses replacing the v1.8.0 single all-optional `SyncAuditPayload` model: `SyncBatchStartedPayload`, `SyncBatchCompletedPayload`, `SyncPushStartedPayload`, `SyncPushCompletedPayload`, `SyncPushDeferredPayload`, `SyncPushFailedPayload`, `SyncPullStartedPayload`, `SyncPullCompletedPayload`, `SyncPullDeferredPayload`, `SyncPullFailedPayload`, `SyncConflictDetectedPayload`, `SyncReconciliationStartedPayload`, `SyncReconciliationCompletedPayload`. Each has `extra="forbid"`; field-vs-action mismatches now fail at validate time.
  - `SyncAuditPayload` preserved as a backwards-compat module-level type-form (`Annotated[Union[...], Field(discriminator="action")]`) — existing imports resolve; callers that used `SyncAuditPayload.model_validate(d)` directly migrate to `TypeAdapter(SyncAuditPayload).validate_python(d)` or look up the concrete subclass via `ACTION_TO_PAYLOAD[action]`.
  - `ACTION_TO_PAYLOAD: dict[str, type[BaseModel]]` exported for direct dispatcher lookup.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/state/sqlite.py`: dispatcher uses the new `ACTION_TO_PAYLOAD` registry; the prior 13 explicit `(SyncAuditPayload, handler)` entries collapse into a single dict comprehension. When a new sync action is added the dispatcher auto-picks it up.

### Added — Multi-provider config (T5)

- `bin/src/fakoli_state/config.py`: new optional top-level `sync.providers` config key parsed into `Config.sync_providers: tuple[str, ...] | None`. Three-way semantics:
  - Key absent → `None` → fall back to `sorted(PROVIDER_REGISTRY)` (v1.8.0 default).
  - `sync.providers: [a, b]` → `("a", "b")` → use the explicit list.
  - `sync.providers: []` → `()` (NOT `None`) → opt out of every provider; sync is a no-op.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/cli/sync.py::_resolve_configured_providers` is the single lookup seam; wrapped in `try/except (ValueError, OSError)` so a malformed config falls back to the registry rather than breaking `fakoli-state sync`. Loud config errors are the job of `init`/`doctor`.
- Documented in `docs/sync-providers.md` § "Per-provider configuration (v1.9.0)" — full schema, three-way table, fallback semantics, reconciliation interaction.

### Added — Phase 7 cleanup (T6)

- **C2 — `RecordedLLMProvider.record_key`:** signature extended to `record_key(system, user, *, max_tokens=4096, temperature=0.0)`; canonical hash folds `str(int(max_tokens))` and `repr(float(temperature))` as length-prefixed chunks 3 and 4. `repr(float(...))` normalises `0`, `0.0`, and `0.00` to the same key. Default values mirror `LLMProvider.generate` defaults so back-compat calls with no kwargs still work. The v1.7.0 footgun where two recordings under different tuning args silently collided is closed; tests that pre-compute keys MUST pass the matching values the engine uses at lookup time (`_SCORE_EXPLAIN_MAX_TOKENS=300`, `_DESCRIPTION_ENRICH_MAX_TOKENS=400`, `_EXPAND_MAX_TOKENS=2000`). Collateral updates to 8 call sites in `tests/test_llm_integration.py` + 1 in `tests/test_cli.py`.
- **C3 — Brainstorm-flow detection:** `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` replaces the fuzzy "if fakoli-flow seems available" prose with an explicit `claude plugin list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^fakoli-flow"` shell check plus exit-code-driven branching. Slash-command name corrected from `/flow:brainstorm` (typo) to the fully-qualified `/fakoli-flow:brainstorm` — the typo would have broken the bridge invocation when fakoli-flow IS installed. Detection is OPTIONAL: exit non-zero (or missing `claude` binary) falls through to the local interview.
- **C4 — `expand --format prd`:** new `--format {text,prd}` Typer option on `fakoli-state expand`. `--format prd` emits ready-to-paste markdown blocks matching `docs/prd-template.md`'s `## Tasks` schema (H3 heading, `**Feature:**`, `**Priority:**`, `**Likely files:**`, description paragraph, `**Acceptance criteria:**` bullets, `**Verification:**` with `TODO` placeholder). `**Feature:**` and `**Priority:**` are populated from the parent task's metadata (Phase 9 critic CONSIDER fix — eliminates the manual-edit step in the paste-into-`prd.md` workflow). Default `--format text` keeps the v1.7.0 human-readable per-subtask block output unchanged. The new mode round-trips cleanly through `parse_prd` — see `tests/test_cli_plan.py::test_prd_format_output_round_trips_to_prd_parser` for the canonical proof.

### Added — Two new plugin-owned doc agents (T4)

- `plugins/fakoli-state/agents/marketplace-scribe.md` — cyan, opus. Owns `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, the root `README.md` plugins table, and `registry/*.json` index files. Fires after any version bump, agent add/remove, or skill add/remove inside fakoli-state. Defers to `fakoli-crew:keeper` when not in a fakoli-state context. Includes `Bash` in `allowed-tools` so it can run `scripts/generate-index.sh` and validate regenerated JSON via `python -m json.tool` / `jq .`.
- `plugins/fakoli-state/agents/docs-scribe.md` — purple, opus. Owns the plugin's `docs/` folder, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the `description` field of `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Audits cross-references between docs — broken `[[wikilinks]]`, mismatched section anchors, dangling `see also` pointers, references to moved/archived files. Fires after any schema change, new CLI command, new agent, or completed phase. Defers to `fakoli-crew:herald` for general README work. No `Bash` (pure docs work).
- Color collisions checked vs the existing four agents (planner=white, critic=magenta, sentinel=gray, state-keeper=teal). Cyan and purple are unused by every existing fakoli-state agent and by every fakoli-crew agent.

### Added — Documentation

- `docs/phase-9-backlog.md` (NEW) — forward-looking v2.x roadmap. Carries the items consciously deferred from Phase 9 (LinearIssuesProvider, MondayBoardsProvider, JiraIssuesProvider, GitHubProjectsProvider, webhook-based sync spec, immediate-apply `*_applied` resolution variants, `fakoli-state snapshot` CLI, MCP sync tools surface, per-provider config nesting), plus the carry-forward `CL-N` / `TQ-N` / `PS-N` items still open in `docs/tech-debt-backlog.md`.
- `docs/github-sync.md` — new "Audit honesty" section explaining `sync.pull.completed` vs `sync.pull.deferred` semantics, the `local_ahead` mapping state, and the full controlled vocabulary of `resolution` tokens (including the new `local_moved_no_push`). Audit events table grows by one (`sync.push.deferred`).
- `docs/sync-providers.md` — new "Per-provider configuration (v1.9.0)" section documenting the optional `sync.providers` config key with the three-way absent/explicit/empty semantics.
- `docs/llm.md` — corrected `RecordedLLMProvider.record_key` signature and example (tuning args participate in the key per Phase 9 C2); new `expand --format prd` worked example with paste-ready output and round-trip note.
- `docs/tech-debt-backlog.md` — new "Phase 8 / Phase 9 closures" section at the top covering P9-1..P9-8 (audit honesty fixes, discriminated payloads, multi-provider config, record_key fix, brainstorm detection, --format prd, two new doc agents). Status legend grows `MOVED-P9-BACKLOG` for items forward-carried to `phase-9-backlog.md`.
- `README.md` — version badge bumped to 1.9.0; phase table marks phases 1–9 Done with per-release version pointers; new "Plugin-owned agents" section listing all six agents (planner, critic, sentinel, state-keeper, marketplace-scribe, docs-scribe) with color + ownership + crew defer-to target.

### Changed

- `bin/src/fakoli_state/state/payloads.py::SyncPullCompletedPayload` docstring — enumerates the four honest emission conditions (clean pull, tombstone, in_sync no-divergence, local-moved-only with paired `sync.push.deferred` hint). The local-moved-only branch is the one most likely to surprise readers who expect "completed" to imply "mutated"; the docstring is explicit that the pull terminal is honest because the pull itself succeeded — only the follow-up push is deferred.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/cli/sync.py::_emit_audit` docstring — updated to reflect that the discriminated union has REQUIRED fields per action now; the None-strip is still load-bearing for OPTIONAL fields with `None` defaults (JSONL would otherwise carry `"audit_note": null` rows that clutter forensic queries and break `jq 'has("audit_note")'` filters).
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/planning/llm.py` module docstring — `RecordedLLMProvider` key shape description corrected from the stale `sha256(system + "---" + user)` to the length-prefixed `sha256` over `(system, user, max_tokens, temperature)`.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/state/payloads.py:393-399` — `TypeAlias` terminology corrected to "module-level type-form (`Annotated[Union[...], Field(discriminator="action")]`)". `SyncAuditPayload` is NOT a `typing.TypeAlias` (no `: TypeAlias =` annotation); it is a Pydantic discriminated-union type form.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/cli/plan.py::_render_subtask_proposals_as_prd` — added optional kw-only `parent_feature_id` and `parent_priority` parameters. The CLI caller (`expand --format prd`) now threads `task.feature_id` and `str(task.priority)` through — eliminates the prior empty `**Feature:**` line and `**Priority:** medium` default that the user had to manually edit before `prd parse`. Default behaviour (when the helper is called without parent context) preserved for backwards compat.
- `tests/test_llm.py::test_separator_prevents_collision` docstring — updated from the stale `"\n---\n"` separator description to "Length-prefixed encoding prevents concat-collisions across any byte boundary." Assertion unchanged.

### Tests

- 935 → 964 passing, 3 skipped (Δ +29 net):
  - +14 new tests authored across T5 / T6: 5 in `test_cli_sync.py` (deferred-branch emission, local_moved_no_push), 7 in `test_config.py` (sync_providers three-way semantics), 2 in `test_sqlite.py` (dispatcher uses concrete subclasses).
  - +4 new tests in `test_llm.py::TestRecordedLLMProviderKey` for the C2 tuning-args participation.
  - +11 new tests in `test_cli_plan.py` (greenfield) covering `--format text` baseline, `--format prd` blocks + round-trip + bullets + headings + suppression of legacy delimiter, validation precedence, and `--help` documentation.
  - 1 inverted-name test: `test_ignores_max_tokens_and_temperature` → `test_distinguishes_max_tokens_and_temperature` (assertions inverted to lock the new contract).
  - 15 pre-existing tests that were failing on T3's payload changes are now passing again (dispatcher fix in `state/sqlite.py`).
- One existing test (`test_prd_format_includes_template_fields`) updated to assert the new `**Feature:** F001` and `**Priority:** high` shape (inherited from the parent T001) rather than the prior empty-Feature / default-medium values.

### Migration notes

- Schema version unchanged (still v3 from v1.8.0). No DB migration required.
- The audit-event action change is forward-compat for log readers: a tool that filtered `sync.pull.completed` on v1.8.0 will now see fewer rows under v1.9.0, but the rows it does see are honest. To recover the union, filter `(.action == "sync.pull.completed" or .action == "sync.pull.deferred")`.
- The `SyncAuditPayload` rename is backwards-compatible at the import path; callers that used `SyncAuditPayload.model_validate(d)` directly must migrate to `TypeAdapter(SyncAuditPayload).validate_python(d)` or look up the concrete subclass via `ACTION_TO_PAYLOAD[action]`.
- `RecordedLLMProvider.record_key` now requires matching `max_tokens` / `temperature` at lookup time when the engine overrides the defaults — tests that pre-computed keys with the no-kwargs form will see `LLMProviderError("no recording for prompt hash ...")` if the engine passes non-default tuning args. The collateral updates in `tests/test_llm_integration.py` (this release) are the template.
- The new `agents/marketplace-scribe.md` and `agents/docs-scribe.md` are created in v1.9.0 but only become invocable as subagent types in NEW sessions (Claude Code discovers agents at session start). Existing sessions need to restart to pick them up.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-25

Phase 8: bidirectional sync. Adds a multi-provider `SyncProvider` Protocol
abstraction with GitHub Issues as the first concrete implementation, wires
opt-in `fakoli-state sync` CLI surface with bidirectional push/pull, four
conflict-resolution strategies, watch-loop polling, and full reconciliation
between SQLite state / filesystem / git. The Protocol is registry-driven
so Monday, Linear, Jira, and custom providers can plug in without engine
changes — see docs/sync-providers.md for the contributor guide.

The schema gains a sync_mappings table (SCHEMA_VERSION 2 → 3) with an
auto-upgrade path for existing v1.7.x databases; the diff is purely
additive. See docs/migrations.md.

### Added — Sync abstraction layer

- `bin/src/fakoli_state/sync/` package — `SyncProvider` Protocol (`push_task`, `fetch_task`, `list_tasks`, `delete_task`, `health_check`), `ExternalRef` + `ExternalTask` + `ProviderHealth` Pydantic models, `SyncProviderError` hierarchy (`AuthenticationFailed`, `RateLimitExceeded`, `ProviderUnavailable`, `SyncConflict`), `RecordedSyncProvider` test double (sha256 length-prefixed keyed), `PROVIDER_REGISTRY` + `register_sync_provider` / `get_sync_provider` / `list_sync_providers`. snake_case `provider_id` discipline.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/sync/providers/github_issues.py` — `GitHubIssuesProvider` concrete impl. Auto-registers as `"github_issues"` on package import. Dual transport: `gh` CLI primary, `httpx` + `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback. Status mapping: 11 TaskStatus values → `status:*` labels; only `done` closes the issue. Body footer convention (`---\n_synced from fakoli-state task {task_id}_`) is round-trippable via `_strip_footer`. Label preservation across pushes (HTTP transport reads existing labels first, preserves non-`status:*`).
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/sync/clients/gh_cli.py` — subprocess wrapper for `gh issue create/edit/view/list/close`. Stderr-scan error classification (auth/rate-limit/network).
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/sync/clients/github_http.py` — httpx wrapper with Link-header pagination + 1000-page safety cap + `responses`-style HTTP mocking via respx in tests.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/sync/reconciliation.py` — `ReconciliationEngine.scan() / fix(dry_run=False)` covering 6 discrepancy kinds: orphan_branch, orphan_packet, orphan_worktree, stale_claim, missing_sync_mapping, drift_sync_state. The first 4 have full fix paths; the latter 2 emit operator-facing CLI commands (`fakoli-state sync provider <id> --pull --task T001`) for Phase 9 immediate-apply.

### Added — State schema (SCHEMA_VERSION 3)

- `sync_mappings` table: composite PK `(task_id, external_system)` + `UNIQUE(external_system, external_id)` (prevents cross-task collisions) + `FK ON DELETE CASCADE` to tasks + `external_url` + `provider_metadata_json`. Auto-upgrade from v1/v2 dbs in `_check_schema_version`; purely additive.
- New Pydantic models: `SyncMapping`, `SyncState`, `ConflictResolutionStrategy` (enums), `ExternalSystem` (snake_case enum).
- New payload models in `state/payloads.py`: `SyncMappingUpsertedPayload`, `SyncMappingDeletedPayload`, `SyncAuditPayload`. All `extra="forbid"`.
- New event handlers in `state/sqlite.py`: `_handle_sync_mapping_upserted`, `_handle_sync_mapping_deleted`, `_handle_sync_audit` (no-op like file_changed / progress.noted).
- New Backend Protocol methods: `get_sync_mapping(task_id, *, external_system=None)`, `list_sync_mappings(external_system=None)`, `apply_sync_mapping(mapping, *, actor='system')` (uses PENDING_EVENT_ID for race-free assignment).
- Nine new `sync.*` audit-event actions: `sync.batch.started/completed`, `sync.push.started/completed/failed`, `sync.pull.started/completed/failed`, `sync.conflict_detected`.

### Added — CLI surface

- `fakoli-state sync` — runs reconciliation only (scan + print report).
- `fakoli-state sync --fix --yes` — reconciliation + apply remediations (`--yes` required for non-interactive; refuses without `--yes` on cron/CI).
- `fakoli-state sync <provider>` — push+pull all tasks via the named provider.
- `fakoli-state sync github` — backwards-compat alias for `sync github_issues`.
- `fakoli-state sync provider <id>` — generic provider invocation.
- Flags: `--push` (push-only), `--pull` (pull-only), `--task T001` (single-task), `--watch --interval N` (long-running poll loop with per-iteration error recovery), `--health` (provider auth probe, works pre-init), `--fix` (forces remote_wins conflict strategy).
- Conflict resolution: per-task `SyncMapping.conflict_resolution_strategy` ∈ {`local_wins`, `remote_wins`, `prompt`, `manual_merge`}. Resolution events emit `*_deferred` audit strings (truthful — actual mutations happen on the next pass; Phase 9 will wire immediate apply). `manual_merge` writes `.fakoli-state/.sync-conflicts/<task_id>.md`; batch exits 2 if any task needed operator input.

### Added — Plugin-owned agent

- `plugins/fakoli-state/agents/state-keeper.md` (color `teal`, model `opus`) — specialized agent for sync drift detection + reconciliation triage. Defers to `fakoli-crew:keeper` when crew is installed.

### Added — Documentation

- `docs/github-sync.md` (245 lines, 12 sections) — user-facing GitHub Issues sync reference.
- `docs/sync-providers.md` (280 lines, 11 sections) — contributor-facing Protocol reference with a step-by-step Linear-provider walkthrough.
- `docs/live-tests.md` — operator runbook for the nightly live-GitHub CI.
- `docs/migrations.md` — already shipped in 1.7.1; documents the v1/v2 → v3 auto-upgrade.

### Added — Nightly CI

- `.github/workflows/fakoli-state-live-github.yml` — daily cron at 06:00 UTC. Gated on `secrets.FAKOLI_STATE_TEST_GH_TOKEN` (job exits 0 with a notice if secret missing). Runs `pytest -m live_github -v` against a real test repo.
- `tests/test_github_issues_live.py` — 3 live tests (lifecycle, label preservation, rate-limit handling). All decorated `@pytest.mark.live_github`; excluded from default `pytest -q` via `addopts = "-m 'not live_github'"` in pyproject.toml. Cleanup contract: every test closes its own issues + leaves a `[fakoli-test]` UUID prefix for orphan sweeping.

### Changed

- `bin/pyproject.toml` — dropped unused `responses>=0.25` dev dep; added `httpx>=0.27` runtime; added `respx>=0.21` dev (for httpx-side HTTP mocking); registered `live_github` pytest marker.
- `cli/__init__.py` — wires the new `sync_app` Typer sub-app into the main CLI.

### Tests

- 750 → 917 baseline tests (+167) plus 3 live-github tests (excluded from default).
- Across waves: 58 sync_provider tests, 23 sync_mapping tests, 82 github_issues_provider tests, 37 reconciliation tests, 42+ cli_sync tests, 4 follow-up + Wave 3 fix-cycle additions.
- Ruff clean. Migration auto-upgrade path tested for v0/v1/v2 → v3.

### Migration notes

- Schema bumps 2 → 3. Existing v1.7.x databases auto-upgrade on first `fakoli-state` invocation under 1.8.0. The diff is purely additive (new table, no shape changes to existing tables). No manual action required.
- The `responses` dev dep has been dropped; if you have a custom test that imported it, switch to `respx` for httpx mocking.
- `fakoli-state sync` is a NEW command. Existing CLI commands are unchanged.

## [1.7.1] — 2026-05-25

Backlog cleanup. Closes 14 items from the deferred review backlog
(`docs/tech-debt-backlog.md`) — 6 correctness fixes (welder), 5 doc/config
cleanups, and the leftover deferrals from the PR #47 critic review. No
behavior changes visible to existing CLI / MCP callers.

### Fixed (correctness — welder backlog wave)

- CL-1: `hooks/check-claim.sh` now invokes the `hook check-claim --file --actor` CLI subcommand (Phase 5) instead of parsing `status --hook-format` output (Phase 4 leftover that fired on any claim regardless of file scope).
- CL-3: `_reap_stale_claims` no longer swallows `SchemaMismatch`; narrowed catch to `(StateLocked, TransactionAborted)` so DDL drift surfaces loudly.
- CL-8: `_handle_evidence_submitted` rejects double-submit with a different `evidence_id` for the same claim; emits the established `warn.idempotent_no_op` JSONL tombstone instead of inserting a duplicate row.
- CL-11: `planning.template.parse_prd` accepts an optional `clock: Clock`; `_parse_tasks` now requires a clock injection instead of calling `datetime.now()` directly.
- CL-13: `SqliteBackend.next_event_id` now raises `RuntimeError` via `_require_conn()` instead of returning the hardcoded `"E000001"` when the connection is closed — eliminates the silent collision-on-reopen footgun.
- PS-1: `ClaimManager._check_group_conflicts` collapses 1+N round-trips into 2 via a single bulk `list_tasks()` + in-memory `dict[task_id, Task]` lookup.

### Fixed (small cleanups)

- CL-7: `agents/critic.md` and `agents/sentinel.md` color collisions with fakoli-crew — state/critic purple → magenta, state/sentinel cyan → gray.
- CL-9: `review.gates._contains_test_keyword` no longer matches `pytest --collect-only` / `--co` (zero-test runs were satisfying the "tests pass" evidence gate).
- CL-14: `skills/finish/SKILL.md` text updated — the apply flow emits a single `task.applied` event, not the nonexistent `review.created` + `task.status_changed` pair.
- PS-2: `init` no longer pre-creates `.fakoli-state/snapshots/`; the directory will be created on first use when `fakoli-state snapshot` ships.

### Fixed (PR #47 critic deferrals)

- S2 / Greptile-G1 (already in 1.7.0): noted closed.
- S5: `template.DESCRIPTION_SHORT_THRESHOLD` is now public; CLI `plan --use-llm` help text references the constant rather than the literal "50".
- N1: comment in `parse_prd` clarifies that HTML-comment stripping runs before the LLM augmentation pass.
- N2: `parse_prd`'s reserved `prd_id` parameter now uses `# noqa: ARG001` instead of the `_ = prd_id` discard idiom.
- N3: `planning.llm._DEFAULT_MODEL` carries a "Last verified" date comment so future maintainers know when to refresh.
- N5: removed the unused `responses>=0.25` dev dependency (the test suite mocks the anthropic SDK at the `unittest.mock` level since `anthropic` uses `httpx`, not `requests`).

### Documentation

- `docs/evidence-buffer.md` (NEW) — format, lifecycle, orphan.json policy, sentinel interaction, cleanup. Closes CL-15.
- `docs/tech-debt-backlog.md` status markers updated: P6-1..P6-5 marked DONE (closed in PR #44); CL-7/CL-9/CL-14/CL-15/PS-2 DONE (this PR); TQ-5 DONE (PR #42 fixup).

### Tests

- 639 → 653 pytest tests (+14): 6 for CL-9 collection-only exclusion, 3 for CL-3 SchemaMismatch propagation, 1 for CL-8 double-submit guard + strengthened existing CL-8 test, 2 for CL-11 clock injection, 1 for CL-13 require-conn guard, 1 for PS-1 N+1 → 2 query collapse.
- 18 → 21 bash hook tests (+3 for CL-1 invocation surface).

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-25

Phase 7: LLM augmentation. Adds an `LLMProvider` Protocol with an Anthropic-backed implementation (ephemeral prompt caching on the system block) and a `RecordedLLMProvider` test double, wires opt-in `--use-llm` flags into `plan`, `score`, and `expand`, and ships a brainstorm skill that bridges to `fakoli-flow:brainstorm`. The deterministic planning engine is unchanged — LLM enrichment is strictly additive and falls back cleanly on missing key, missing recording, or mid-operation failure.

### Added

- `bin/src/fakoli_state/planning/llm.py` — `LLMProvider` Protocol + `AnthropicProvider` (with ephemeral prompt-caching on the system block per the claude-api skill guidance) + `RecordedLLMProvider` for deterministic tests + `LLMResponse` Pydantic model + `LLMProviderError`. Default model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`; API key sourced from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var.
- `--use-llm` flag on `fakoli-state plan`, `score`, and `expand`. Off by default — opt-in augmentation that enriches deterministic output (score explanations, short task descriptions, sub-task proposals for complex tasks).
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/planning/inference.py::expand_task` — new function returning `list[SubtaskProposal]`. Deterministic path returns `[]`; with provider + `complexity >= 4`, calls LLM to propose 2-5 sub-tasks. JSON-parse-tolerant; malformed responses fall back to `[]` with a warning.
- `plugins/fakoli-state/skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` — interview-style PRD authoring skill. Bridges to `fakoli-flow:brainstorm` when installed; standalone otherwise.
- `docs/llm.md` — provider config, prompt-caching usage, `RecordedLLMProvider` test pattern, failure modes.
- 46 new tests: 29 in `tests/test_llm.py` (provider unit tests), 17 in `tests/test_llm_integration.py` (engine integration via `RecordedLLMProvider`), plus 10 new CLI flag tests in `tests/test_cli.py`.

### Changed

- `planning.scoring.score_task` / `score_all` — new kw-only `provider: LLMProvider | None = None`. Default behavior unchanged.
- `planning.template.parse_prd` — new kw-only `provider: LLMProvider | None = None`. Default behavior unchanged.
- LLM failures during augmentation print a warning to stderr; the engine returns the deterministic-only result. LLM augmentation never aborts a planning operation.

### Technical notes

- One ephemeral cache breakpoint on the system block per Anthropic call. Repeated `score --use-llm` runs against the same task batch hit the cache and pay only for new user tokens.
- `RecordedLLMProvider` keys are a length-prefixed `sha256` over `(system, user)` — tests pre-compute via `RecordedLLMProvider.record_key(...)`. (v1.9.0 extended the key to include `max_tokens` and `temperature` — see the v1.9.0 entry above.)

Tests: 613 → 640 + Wave 3a additions (Wave 3a may add a few more — total to be confirmed at sentinel time).

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-25

Phase 6: MCP server. Exposes 13 agent-facing tools via FastMCP (stdio), wires them into Claude Code via `.mcp.json`, adds the `progress.noted` audit event, and ships 50 MCP integration tests. Any agent in a project with fakoli-state installed now has direct programmatic access to the full state engine without shelling out to the CLI.

### Added

- `bin/src/fakoli_state/mcp_server.py` — FastMCP (stdio) server with 13 agent-facing tools. Read-only tools: `get_project_summary`, `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `get_next_task`, `generate_work_packet`, `check_conflicts`, `get_dependency_graph`. Mutating tools: `claim_task`, `release_task`, `renew_claim`, `submit_progress`, `submit_completion_evidence`, `update_task_status`. Stale-claim reaping runs at the top of `get_project_summary` and all six mutating tools. The server opens a fresh `SqliteBackend` per tool call (`Path.cwd() / .fakoli-state`) — agents in different cwds see their own state, no leakage.
- `plugins/fakoli-state/.mcp.json` — wires `fakoli-state-mcp` as a stdio MCP server via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/fakoli-state-mcp`. Claude Code agents in any project with this plugin installed automatically see the 13 tools.
- `progress.noted` event action — audit-only, structurally parallel to `file_changed`. New `ProgressNotedPayload` in `state/payloads.py` and a no-op handler in `sqlite.py`. Emitted by `submit_progress`.
- `docs/mcp.md` — 645-line full tool reference covering each tool's signature, return shape, error cases, integration notes for fakoli-flow / fakoli-crew, and the documented error envelope contract.
- 50 new MCP integration tests in `tests/test_mcp.py` via the FastMCP in-process Client. 2 additional `progress.noted` payload tests in the existing payload test suite.

### Changed

- `bin/fakoli-state-mcp` — wrapper now executes `python -m fakoli_state.mcp_server` via `uv run` (fully functional). The Phase-6 "not yet implemented" guard block is removed.

### Technical notes

- Error envelope: tools raise `fastmcp.exceptions.ToolError(message)` with a human-readable string. The spec's structured `{code, message, target_id, payload}` envelope is deferred — the documented contract lives in `docs/mcp.md`.
- The process-per-request connection pattern keeps the server a thin shim. No shared in-process state, no connection pooling concerns across concurrent agent calls.

Tests: 530 → 580 (+50 MCP integration tests, +2 payload tests). Ruff clean.

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-25

Phase 6 prep: backend / state-engine refactors that unblock the MCP server
(landing next in Phase 6 proper) by closing the five must-fix items from the
PR #41 critic and Greptile reviews tracked as P6-1..P6-5 in
`docs/tech-debt-backlog.md`.

### Added

- `bin/src/fakoli_state/cli/` — new package replacing the 2,499-line `cli.py`
  monolith. Per-command modules: `init_status`, `prd`, `plan`, `claim`,
  `packet_apply`, `hooks`, plus `_helpers` for shared utilities and
  `__init__.py` as the Typer-app assembler. Public import path
  (`from fakoli_state.cli import app`) is unchanged. (P6-4)
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/state/payloads.py` — 17 per-action Pydantic v2 payload
  models (`ProjectCreatedPayload`, `PrdParsedPayload`,
  `EvidenceSubmittedPayload`, etc.) all using `ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`.
  `SqliteBackend._apply_mutation` now validates `event.payload_json` against
  the model for `event.action` once before dispatch, replacing the 17-elif
  chain with a `dict[str, (PayloadModel, handler)]` table. Handler signatures
  normalize to `(conn, payload: TypedPayload, event: Event)` — handlers read
  fields via attribute access rather than `payload.get(...)`. (P6-5)
- `Backend` Protocol gains three methods previously only on the SqliteBackend
  reach-through: `get_feature(feature_id)`, `list_events(target_id,
  target_kind, limit)`, `get_latest_evidence(task_id)`. The CLI no longer
  touches `backend._conn` directly; the three call sites in
  `cli/_helpers.py` (`_fetch_recent_events`, `_fetch_latest_evidence`)
  collapse into Protocol calls. (P6-1)
- `PENDING_EVENT_ID = "PENDING"` sentinel on `state.backend`. Callers
  construct events as `Event(id=PENDING_EVENT_ID, ...)` and the backend
  assigns the real `E000001`-format ID inside `apply_event`'s BEGIN IMMEDIATE
  transaction, closing the read-before-lock race that allowed event drops
  under concurrent claim/release. (P6-2)
- 37 new test cases in `tests/test_sqlite.py::TestPayloadValidation`
  covering each payload model's happy path and `extra="forbid"` rejection
  plus dispatch-level `ValidationError` propagation.
- 7 new test cases in `tests/test_sqlite.py::TestBackendProtocolExtensions`
  covering the three new Protocol methods.

### Changed

- All CLI commands and `claims.stale.detect_and_release_stale()` now emit
  events via `PENDING_EVENT_ID` instead of pre-allocating IDs through
  `backend.next_event_id()`. `next_event_id()` remains for backward
  compatibility but is documented as the legacy path.
- `SqliteBackend.apply_event` rewrites `event.id` in place when the sentinel
  is passed and returns the updated event so callers can recover the assigned
  ID without re-querying.

### Removed

- `bin/src/fakoli_state/cli.py` — replaced by the package above. Imports
  resolve identically.
- `TaskStatus.stale` from `state.models` and the corresponding
  `task_to_stale` / `task_stale_to_ready` transitions. The state was
  structurally unreachable — only claims can be stale, and the task returns
  directly to `ready` when the claim is reaped. Task lifecycle ASCII diagram
  in `docs/specs/2026-05-24-fakoli-state-v0.md` updated. CL-16 (claim.stale
  task transition skips the intermediate `stale` state) is resolved as a
  side-effect. (P6-3)
- `cli/_helpers.py::_fetch_recent_events` and `_fetch_latest_evidence` —
  callers now go through the Protocol methods.

### Migration notes

- External code calling `apply_event` should switch to passing
  `Event(id=PENDING_EVENT_ID, ...)` to get race-free ID assignment. Pre-built
  events with concrete IDs still work (the replay path requires this) but the
  pre-allocation path is racy under concurrency.
- Subclasses of `Backend` must implement the three new methods or accept the
  `NotImplementedError` from the Protocol default.
- The CLI external surface (`fakoli-state <subcommand>`) is unchanged.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-25

Docs-only patch release. Stages the deferred items from the PR #41 critic +
Greptile reviews into a single backlog document so Phase 6 work picks them
up explicitly without re-reading chat transcripts.

### Added

- `docs/tech-debt-backlog.md` — 31 open items + 11 already-closed (for
  reference), grouped into: Phase 6 must-close (5), Cleanup (16), Test
  quality (8), Performance (2). Each entry cites its source (Greptile,
  Critic-1/2/3/4) and includes a concrete fix sketch.

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-25

Phase 5: Context engine. Delivers the context engine, review apply gate, three new CLI commands, one new hook subcommand, two new skills, two new plugin-owned agents, a new PostToolUse hook, state engine extensions, and a comprehensive test suite. The plugin now supports the complete claim → packet → work → submit → apply lifecycle.

### Added

- Context engine (`context/packets.py`) — `render_packet()` produces both markdown (for `.fakoli-state/packets/T001.md`) and JSON (for MCP `get_work_packet` in Phase 6). Pure function; no I/O.
- Review engine apply gate (`review/gates.py`) — `evidence_complete(task, evidence)` validates that submitted Evidence satisfies the task's `required_evidence` list; surfaces specific missing items.
- Three new CLI commands: `packet TASK_ID [--format md|json]`, `submit TASK_ID --commands ... --files-changed ... [--output-file --pr-url --commit-sha --known-limitations --actor]`, `apply TASK_ID [--approve | --reject] [--reason --reviewer]`.
- One new hook subcommand: `fakoli-state hook capture-evidence --command --exit-code --stdout-file --stderr-file --actor` — used by the new PostToolUse Bash hook.
- Two new skills: `skills/execute/SKILL.md` (full claim → packet → work → submit loop; coordinates with `fakoli-flow:execute` when installed) and `skills/finish/SKILL.md` (apply + ship decision: merge/PR/keep/discard).
- Two new plugin-owned agents: `agents/critic.md` (code reviewer; defers to `fakoli-crew:critic`) and `agents/sentinel.md` (evidence validator; defers to `fakoli-crew:sentinel`). Both `allowed-tools` exclude Edit/Write (Iron Rule at tool-permission level).
- New PostToolUse hook: `hooks/capture-evidence.sh` (Bash matcher) — captures stdout/stderr/exit-code of verification commands (`pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `npm test`, `cargo test`, `bun test`) into `.fakoli-state/.evidence-buffer/` per-claim JSON files for later attachment to Evidence.
- State engine: 2 new event handlers (`evidence.submitted`, `task.applied`) both routed via `_apply_mutation`. `evidence.submitted` atomically inserts Evidence + transitions task to `needs_review` + auto-releases the active claim. `task.applied` combines `needs_review` → `accepted` → `done` in one transaction when `decision='accepted'`.
- 81 new tests (403 → 484): `test_context.py` (24 tests), `test_review.py` (20), `test_sqlite.py` extensions (16 new Phase 5 handler tests + the audit replay test for `evidence` + `applied`), `test_cli.py` extensions (17 new), `test_hooks.sh` extensions (5 new capture-evidence smoke tests).
- Coverage: context 93%, review 97%, state 95.70%, claims 99%, overall 91.16%.
- Audit guarantee extended: `TestReplayIncludesPhase5Events` byte-compares `sqlite3 .dump` after replaying the full lifecycle including `evidence.submitted` and `task.applied` (both accepted and rejected branches).

### Fixed

- Dead-code unreachable branch in `_handle_evidence_submitted` — `if commands_run is None` was never reachable because the field defaulted to `[]`. Fixed to `if not commands_run` which catches both None and empty (submitting evidence with no verification commands is meaningless).

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-24

Phase 4: Claims manager. Delivers atomic claim/release/renew/next semantics with lease and heartbeat enforcement, git branch auto-creation, two new bash hooks, a claim skill, and a comprehensive test suite. The plugin now supports the complete claim-based coordination workflow for AI agents working in parallel.

### Added

- Claims manager (`claims/manager.py` — atomic claim/release/renew with lease and heartbeat semantics; Clock-injected for deterministic tests).
- Stale claim detector (`claims/stale.py` — runs on every CLI invocation; returns expired claims back to the ready pool with audit trail).
- Four new CLI commands: `claim TASK_ID [--worktree] [--force] [--actor]`, `release CLAIM_ID [--force] [--reason]`, `renew CLAIM_ID`, `next [--actor]`.
- Hook sub-app: `fakoli-state hook check-claim` and `fakoli-state hook record-file-change` (used by the new bash hooks).
- Git ops module: `git_ops/branch.py` auto-creates `agent/<task>-<slug>` branches on claim (with name-collision suffix, graceful no-op when git absent); `git_ops/worktree.py` for optional `--worktree` parallel-checkout.
- Two new hooks: `check-claim.sh` (PreToolUse on Edit|Write|NotebookEdit; warns when active claims exist) and `record-file-change.sh` (PostToolUse; appends file_changed events to the audit log).
- New skill: `skills/claim/SKILL.md` — workflow choreography for the claim → work → renew → release loop.
- State engine: 4 new event handlers (`claim.created`, `claim.released`, `claim.renewed`, `claim.stale`) all routed through `_apply_mutation` dispatch.
- 98 new tests (300 → 398): `test_claims.py` (concurrency-critical, `claims/` coverage 99%), `test_git_ops.py` (real git per test), `test_hooks.sh` (11 bash smoke tests), extended `test_sqlite.py` and `test_cli.py`.
- Audit guarantee extended: `TestReplayIncludesPhase4ClaimActions` byte-compares `sqlite3 .dump` after replaying `claim.created` → `claim.renewed` → `claim.released`; companion `test_replay_includes_claim_stale` covers the stale path.

### Fixed

- `claims/stale.py` event payload was missing the required `reason` field expected by `_handle_claim_stale` (caught by Wave 3 tests).
- `_handle_claim_released` was incorrectly requiring `release_reason` — payload field is optional and the ClaimManager legitimately passes None when no reason is given.

### Notes

- Stale claim reaping is automatic on every mutating CLI command (`claim`, `release`, `renew`, `next`); users don't need to think about it.
- Claims survive without git: when git is absent or cwd is not a git repo, the claim succeeds without a branch and prints a warning (record-only mode).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-24

Phase 3: Planning engine. Delivers the full planning runtime — deterministic PRD parser, six-dimension scoring engine, dependency and conflict-group inference, eight new CLI subcommands, two new skills, a new agent, and a PRD template doc. The plugin now supports the complete PRD-to-ready-tasks workflow without LLM augmentation.

### Added

- Planning engine: deterministic template parser (`planning/template.py` — turns structured markdown into Pydantic Requirements/Features/Tasks; full quick-start example documented at `docs/prd-template.md`).
- Six-dimension scoring engine (`planning/scoring.py` — rule-based heuristics for complexity, parallelizability, context_load, blast_radius, review_risk, agent_suitability; explanation string per task).
- Dependency and conflict-group inference (`planning/inference.py` — subset-overlap heuristic for dependencies, partial-overlap detection for conflict groups).
- Eight new CLI subcommands: `prd parse`, `prd review [--approve]`, `plan`, `score [TASK_ID]`, `expand TASK_ID` (Phase 7 scaffold), `review tasks`, `list [--status STATUS --feature F]`, `show TASK_ID`.
- Two new skills: `skills/prd/` (PRD authoring/review workflow) and `skills/plan/` (PRD → ready tasks workflow), both following the state-ops imperative-voice and scannable-description conventions.
- New agent: `agents/planner.md` (PRD-to-tasks specialist; defers to `fakoli-crew:guido` when fakoli-crew is installed; allowed-tools excludes Edit/Write to enforce the "propose, don't mutate" Iron Rule at the tool-permission level).
- PRD template doc (`docs/prd-template.md` — ~2,500 words; quick-start JSON-to-YAML converter example demonstrates every documented field).
- SQLite event router extended with 8 new actions: `prd.parsed`, `prd.reviewed`, `prd.approved`, `feature.created`, `task.created`, `task.scored`, `task.expanded`, `task.status_changed`; all routed via `_apply_mutation` dispatch; replay-from-empty handles all 8.

### Fixed

- `_insert_task_row` switched from `INSERT OR REPLACE` to `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` to preserve task row identity across `plan` re-runs. `INSERT OR REPLACE` is DELETE+INSERT, which trips `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on `claims.task_id` and `evidence.task_id` once work has begun. Regression test: `test_plan_is_idempotent`.

### Tests

- 122 new tests (174 → 296). `state/` coverage 95.05% (audit-critical), `planning/` ~93%, `cli` ~88%, overall 92.72%.
- Audit guarantee extended: `test_replay_includes_new_event_actions` byte-compares `sqlite3 .dump` before/after replaying a mixed sequence of all 8 new event actions.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-24

Phase 2: State engine. Delivers the full runtime core — data models, state machine, SQLite backend, event log, CLI, skill, hook, and test suite. The plugin is now operationally useful for tracking project state.

### Added

- State engine: Pydantic v2 models (14 entities) in `state/models.py` — `Project`, `Requirement`, `Feature`, `Task`, `Claim`, `Evidence`, `FileChange`, `Snapshot`, `TaskScore`, `SnapshotEntry`, `Config`, and supporting enums (`TaskStatus`, `ClaimStatus`, `EvidenceKind`).
- Pure state machine transitions in `state/transitions.py` — 17 transition functions plus `TransitionError` and gate helper predicates; no I/O, fully deterministic.
- Backend Protocol + concrete `SqliteBackend` in `state/sqlite.py` — WAL journal mode, JSONL event log (`events.jsonl`) written atomically on every mutation, full replay guarantee.
- DDL schema generator (`state/schema.py`) — foreign keys, composite indexes, schema versioning table; generates idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` SQL.
- Clock Protocol with `SystemClock` and `FrozenClock` for deterministic tests — injected via `SqliteBackend(clock=...)`.
- Config loader (`config.py`) — reads `config.yaml` from the `.fakoli-state/` directory; Pydantic-validated; falls back to sensible defaults.
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker — `fakoli_state` is now a typed package.
- CLI subcommand `init` — scaffolds `.fakoli-state/` directory in the caller's project: `config.yaml`, `state.db`, `events.jsonl`, `prd.md`, `packets/`, and `snapshots/`. Fixed a wrapper bug (`--project "$BIN_DIR"` → wrapper now passes `--project` to preserve the caller's working directory so `init` scaffolds in the correct location).
- CLI subcommand `status` — human-readable summary of project state; `--hook-format` flag emits compact key=value pairs for hook consumption.
- First skill: `state-ops` — covers common state inspection and manipulation workflows from within Claude Code.
- `SessionStart` hook `detect-state.sh` — detects `.fakoli-state/state.db` in the project root on session start and surfaces a brief status banner to the agent.
- 173 tests covering `state/models.py`, `state/transitions.py`, `state/sqlite.py`, CLI (`init`, `status`, `--version`), `config.py`, and the `detect-state.sh` hook; 94% overall coverage, 95% on `state/`.
- Audit-guarantee test `test_replay_from_empty_reconstructs_state_exactly` — replays `events.jsonl` from scratch against an empty database and asserts byte-for-byte equality with the live `state.db`.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-24

Phase 1: Plugin scaffold. No executable state operations ship in this release — this entry records the structural foundation that all subsequent phases build on. Version 1.0.0 follows the fakoli-plugins repository convention that new plugins ship at 1.0.0 regardless of feature completeness (per `CLAUDE.md` § New Plugin Checklist).

### Added

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest declaring name, version (`1.0.0`), description, author, repository, license, and marketplace keywords.
- `README.md` — positions fakoli-state against CCPM and issue-tracker-as-state patterns; documents the "5 must-do-better" list; install instructions (git clone until marketplace publication); Quick Start teaser for the intended `fakoli-state init` flow; architecture overview; 8-phase build status table; integration notes for fakoli-flow and fakoli-crew.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file; Keep a Changelog format.
- `LICENSE` — MIT license, copyright 2026 Sekou Doumbouya.
- `docs/specs/2026-05-24-fakoli-state-v0.md` — canonical build specification: data model, CLI command set, MCP tool surface, hook event mappings, phasing plan, and integration contracts.
- `bin/fakoli-state` — bash wrapper that invokes `uv run python -m fakoli_state.cli`; `--version` stub returns `1.0.0`.
- `bin/fakoli-state-mcp` — bash wrapper that invokes `uv run python -m fakoli_state.mcp_server`; stubbed pending Phase 6 with a clean error message instead of a raw Python traceback.
- `bin/pyproject.toml` — uv-managed Python project (Hatchling build backend); declares dependencies: Typer, Pydantic v2, FastMCP, and test tooling (pytest, ruff, mypy, responses).
- `bin/uv.lock` — locked dependency tree for reproducible installs.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/__init__.py` — package init; exports `__version__ = "1.0.0"`.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/cli.py` — Typer application; single `--version` flag functional; all other subcommands stubbed with `typer.echo("Not yet implemented")`.
- Skeleton directories establishing the plugin layout: `skills/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `tests/`, `docs/`.
