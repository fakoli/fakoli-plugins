"""Regression test for version-string sync across fakoli-state's three
Python source-of-truth files. Added after structure-critic MUST FIX on
PR #65 caught `__init__.py` stale at 1.16.0 while every other source
was at 1.17.0.

The three sources that MUST agree (the Python world):

  1. ``bin/pyproject.toml`` — what pip / uv reads at install
  2. ``bin/src/fakoli_state/__init__.py`` — what ``import fakoli_state``
     exposes as ``__version__`` at runtime
  3. ``.claude-plugin/plugin.json`` — what Claude Code's plugin loader
     reads at install/load

The marketplace.json and registry/*.json entries are derived from
plugin.json by ``scripts/generate-index.sh`` — they are checked by
``scripts/validate.sh`` in CI, not by this test. README badges are
documentation, not source of truth — also not checked here.
