## Conventions

- Every command supports `--help`. Run `fakoli-state <command> --help` to see
  the live Typer-generated output.
- Every command that needs a project directory accepts a hidden `--cwd PATH`
  override. Without it, the command resolves `.fakoli-state/` from the current
  working directory.
- Mutating commands write to `state.db` (SQLite) **and** append a JSON line to
  `events.jsonl` in the same transaction. The event log is the source of
  truth; `state.db` is a derived projection that can be rebuilt by replaying
  `events.jsonl`. See [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) for the replay
  contract.
- Actor identity for claims, submissions, and reviews defaults to `$USER`,
  then `agent` (or `human` for `apply`). Override with `--actor`,
  `--reviewer`, etc.
- Exit codes (consistent across the CLI):
  - `0` — success (including informational no-op states like "no tasks to
    score" or `status --hook-format` on an uninitialised project).
  - `1` — state / gate / validation error (task not found, gate failed,
    `--use-llm` without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, parse errors, mutually exclusive
    flag conflicts, missing required `--reason`, etc.).
  - `2` — operator-input required. Currently emitted only by
    `sync` / `sync github` / `sync provider` when one or more tasks parked
    awaiting `manual_merge` resolution.

## Global flags

These appear on the root `fakoli-state` invocation, before any subcommand.

- `--version`, `-V` — print the version (e.g. `fakoli-state 1.10.0`) and exit.
- `--help` — show root help and exit. Listing the registered commands and
  sub-apps; equivalent to `fakoli-state` with no arguments
  (`no_args_is_help=True`).

---

## Project lifecycle

### `fakoli-state init` { #init }

**Synopsis:** Scaffold a `.fakoli-state/` directory in the current working
directory. Creates `config.yaml`, `state.db` (SQLite, with the canonical
schema), an empty append-only `events.jsonl`, and an empty `packets/`
subdirectory. Emits `project.created` and `state.initialized` events to seed
the project row.

**Flags:**

- `--name TEXT` *(optional)* — human-readable project name. Defaults to the
  basename of the current directory.
- `--id TEXT` *(optional)* — project identifier slug (e.g. `my-project`).
  Defaults to a slug derived from `--name`.
- `--force` *(flag)* — overwrite an existing `.fakoli-state/` directory.
  Wipes `state.db` (including the `-wal` / `-shm` sidecars), `events.jsonl`,
  and `config.yaml`. Preserves `packets/` and `snapshots/` (user-generated).

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — initialisation succeeded.
- `1` — `.fakoli-state/` already exists and `--force` was not passed; or the
  current directory is the fakoli-state plugin root itself (init refuses to
  scaffold inside the plugin).

**Example:**

```bash
cd ~/projects/acme-api
fakoli-state init --name "Acme API"
```

**See also:** [`how-to/getting-started.md`](how-to/getting-started.md) for the
end-to-end first-project walkthrough; [`fakoli-state status`](#status) to
inspect the result.

### `fakoli-state status` { #status }

**Synopsis:** Show the current `fakoli-state` summary for this project.
Default output is a human-readable multi-line block (project name, id, path,
initialised-at, PRD status, task counts by status, active claim count, sync
configuration). Pass `--hook-format` for the single-line compact format
consumed by the SessionStart `detect-state.sh` hook.

**Flags:**

- `--hook-format` *(flag)* — emit a single compact line for hook consumption
  (e.g. `active-claims:0 ready-tasks:5 blockers:0 prd-status:approved`).
  Exits 0 even when `fakoli-state` is not initialised — hooks must never
  fail the session.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory to inspect. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — status printed successfully, **or** `--hook-format` was used on an
  uninitialised project (prints the literal string `uninitialized`).
- `1` — `.fakoli-state/` does not exist and `--hook-format` was *not* passed.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state status
fakoli-state status --hook-format     # for SessionStart hooks
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state init`](#init) to create the directory;
[`fakoli-state list`](#list) for the per-task view.

---

## PRD authoring

### `fakoli-state prd parse` { #prd-parse }

**Synopsis:** Parse `.fakoli-state/prd.md` (or `--file PATH`) and store the
result as a `prd.parsed` event. Calls the template parser, validates the
required sections, and persists the full PRD payload (summary, goals,
non-goals, requirements, acceptance criteria, risks, open questions).

**Flags:**

- `--file PATH` *(optional)* — path to the PRD markdown file. Defaults to
  `.fakoli-state/prd.md` in the current project directory.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — PRD parsed and `prd.parsed` event recorded. Prints the count of
  requirements, features, and tasks found.
- `1` — PRD file not found, unreadable, or contains parse errors (every error
  is printed to stderr with `[section:line] message` formatting).

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state prd parse
fakoli-state prd parse --file ./drafts/v2-prd.md
```

**See also:** [`how-to/authoring-a-prd.md`](how-to/authoring-a-prd.md);
[`docs/prd-template.md`](prd-template.md) for the required section structure;
[`fakoli-state prd review`](#prd-review) for the next step.

### `fakoli-state prd review` { #prd-review }

**Synopsis:** Transition the PRD through the review lifecycle. Without
`--approve`: `draft` → `reviewed` (emits `prd.reviewed`). With `--approve`:
`reviewed` → `approved` (emits `prd.approved`).

**Flags:**

- `--approve` *(flag)* — approve the PRD (transition `reviewed` → `approved`).
  Without this flag the command performs the `draft` → `reviewed` transition.
- `--reviewer TEXT` *(default: `human`)* — identity of the reviewer recorded
  in the event payload.
- `--notes TEXT` *(optional)* — optional review notes (recorded on the
  `prd.reviewed` event).
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — transition recorded successfully.
- `1` — no PRD in state (run `prd parse` first); or the PRD is in the wrong
  status for the requested transition (e.g. `--approve` invoked while the
  PRD is still `draft`).

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state prd review --reviewer "alex" --notes "scope looks good"
fakoli-state prd review --approve --reviewer "alex"
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state prd parse`](#prd-parse);
[`fakoli-state plan`](#plan) for the next step.

---

## Planning

### `fakoli-state plan` { #plan }

**Synopsis:** Generate features and tasks from the parsed PRD. Re-reads
`prd.md`, emits `feature.created` and `task.created` events for each feature
and task found, runs dependency and conflict-group inference, then promotes
all freshly-`proposed` tasks to `drafted`. Idempotent — re-running does not
duplicate tasks (INSERT OR REPLACE semantics) and never regresses status of
tasks that have already advanced past `drafted`.

**Flags:**

- `--use-llm` *(flag)* — augment planning with Anthropic Claude. Requires
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment. Deterministic output is always
  produced first; LLM enrichment is additive (it enriches task descriptions
  shorter than the 50-character threshold). LLM failures fall back to the
  deterministic description with a stderr warning — `plan` never aborts on
  LLM failure.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — planning succeeded. Prints `Planned N features, M tasks.` and any
  detected conflict-group count.
- `1` — `prd.md` not found or unreadable; or `--use-llm` was passed without
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in environment.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state plan
fakoli-state plan --use-llm        # requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state score`](#score) and
[`fakoli-state review tasks`](#review-tasks) for the next steps in the
planning lifecycle; [`docs/llm.md`](llm.md) for the LLM augmentation
contract.

### `fakoli-state score` { #score }

**Synopsis:** Score tasks across six rule-based dimensions (complexity,
parallelizability, context_load, blast_radius, review_risk,
agent_suitability). Without a task id: scores every task whose scores are
incomplete. With a task id: scores that single task. Emits one `task.scored`
event per task and prints a summary table.

**Positional arguments:**

- `TASK_ID` *(optional)* — task id to score. Omit to score all tasks whose
  scores are currently incomplete.

**Flags:**

- `--use-llm` *(flag)* — append the rule-based explanation with a 1-3
  sentence trade-off summary from the LLM. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The
  numeric scores themselves are never modified by the LLM.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — scoring completed (including the "no tasks require scoring" no-op).
- `1` — specified `TASK_ID` not found; or `--use-llm` was passed without
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in environment.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state score                # score every unscored task
fakoli-state score T003
fakoli-state score T003 --use-llm
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state show`](#show) for the per-task scores breakdown;
[`fakoli-state expand`](#expand) to decompose high-complexity tasks.

### `fakoli-state expand` { #expand }

**Synopsis:** Expand a high-complexity task into 2-5 sub-task proposals via
the LLM. **Requires `--use-llm`** — the deterministic engine never invents
sub-tasks; the deterministic path is manual authoring of `T001.1`, `T001.2`
entries in `prd.md`. Only tasks with `complexity >= 4` are decomposed;
lower-complexity tasks return no proposals. This command does **not** mutate
state — proposals are printed for the human to paste into `prd.md`.

**Positional arguments:**

- `TASK_ID` *(required)* — task id to expand into subtasks.

**Flags:**

- `--use-llm` *(required)* — without this flag, `expand` exits 1 with the
  message pointing at the manual-authoring fallback. With it, the LLM is
  asked for 2-5 independently-claimable sub-task proposals.
- `--format {text,prd}` *(default: `text`)* — `text` prints a human-readable
  per-subtask block; `prd` renders markdown blocks matching
  [`docs/prd-template.md`](prd-template.md) — paste-ready into the `## Tasks`
  section of `.fakoli-state/prd.md`, inheriting the parent's `feature_id`
  and priority.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — proposals printed (or the task is below the complexity threshold —
  this is a non-error no-op).
- `1` — `--use-llm` was not passed; or `--format` was not one of
  `text` / `prd`; or `TASK_ID` not found; or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is missing.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state expand T012 --use-llm
fakoli-state expand T012 --use-llm --format prd >> .fakoli-state/prd.md
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state score`](#score) (run first to populate the
complexity score); [`docs/llm.md`](llm.md);
[`fakoli-state prd parse`](#prd-parse) to re-parse after pasting blocks.

### `fakoli-state review tasks` { #review-tasks }

**Synopsis:** Promote tasks through the review lifecycle in two stages:
`drafted` → `reviewed`, then `reviewed` → `ready`. The `drafted` → `reviewed`
gate requires non-empty `acceptance_criteria` AND non-empty
`verification.commands`. Prints a summary of how many tasks were promoted at
each stage and lists any blocked tasks with the gate-failure reason.

**Flags:**

- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — pass completed. Tasks that failed the gate are listed in the output
  but do not change the exit code (this is a batch operation; per-task
  failures are informational).

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state review tasks
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state list`](#list) to inspect the current statuses;
[`fakoli-state plan`](#plan) for the prior step.

### `fakoli-state list` { #list }

**Synopsis:** List tasks with optional status and feature filters. Prints a
table with columns: TaskID, Title, Status, Priority, Score
(`complexity/agent_suitability` or `unscored`), Feature.

**Flags:**

- `--status TEXT` *(optional)* — filter by task status (e.g. `ready`,
  `drafted`, `reviewed`, `in_progress`, `needs_review`, `done`).
- `--feature TEXT` *(optional)* — filter by feature id (e.g. `F001`).
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — table printed, or the friendly "No tasks found" message.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state list
fakoli-state list --status ready
fakoli-state list --feature F001 --status drafted
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state show`](#show) for the per-task detail;
[`fakoli-state next`](#next) for the recommendation.

### `fakoli-state show` { #show }

**Synopsis:** Print full task detail in a human-readable multi-section
format. Sections: title, feature, status, priority, scores breakdown (all
six dimensions plus explanation), dependencies, conflict groups, acceptance
criteria, verification commands, likely files, active claim (if any), and
the 10 most recent events targeting this task.

**Positional arguments:**

- `TASK_ID` *(required)* — task id to display (e.g. `T001`).

**Flags:**

- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — task printed.
- `1` — `TASK_ID` not found.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state show T001
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state list`](#list) for the table view;
[`fakoli-state claim`](#claim) once you have decided to pick it up.

---

## Claims and work

### `fakoli-state next` { #next }

**Synopsis:** Pick the highest-priority claimable task **without** claiming
it. Prints the recommended task id, title, priority, and complexity. Run
`fakoli-state claim TASK_ID` to acquire the lease after reviewing the
recommendation. Reaps any stale claims (expired leases) before recommending.

**Flags:**

- `--actor TEXT` *(optional)* — actor identity; defaults to `$USER` or
  `agent`. Used to scope the "claimable by me" filter when implemented.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — recommendation printed, or "No claimable tasks available." printed.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state next
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state claim`](#claim) to actually pick up the task;
[`fakoli-state list`](#list) for the broader view.

### `fakoli-state claim` { #claim }

**Synopsis:** Acquire an exclusive lease on `TASK_ID` and create an
`agent/<task>-<slug>` git branch. Reaps stale claims, runs the pre-claim
conflict check (file overlap with active claims and conflict-group
membership), and records a `claim.created` event. Optionally creates a git
worktree at `../wt-<task_id>/`.

**Positional arguments:**

- `TASK_ID` *(required)* — task id to claim (e.g. `T001`).

**Flags:**

- `--worktree` *(flag)* — also create a git worktree at `../wt-<task_id>/`.
  Skipped with a stderr warning when no branch was created (e.g. when the
  branch already exists).
- `--force` *(flag)* — override the pre-claim conflict warnings. Without
  `--force`, file overlap or group conflicts cause the command to exit 1
  after listing every conflicting claim.
- `--actor TEXT` *(optional)* — claim actor; defaults to `$USER` or
  `agent`.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — claim acquired. Prints the claim id, lease expiry, branch name, and
  optional worktree path.
- `1` — `TASK_ID` not found, pre-claim conflicts detected without `--force`,
  or the `ClaimManager` rejected the claim (task in wrong status, already
  claimed by another actor, lease overlap, etc.).

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state claim T001
fakoli-state claim T001 --worktree --actor "alex"
fakoli-state claim T001 --force            # override conflict warnings
```

**See also:**
[`how-to/claiming-and-shipping-a-task.md`](how-to/claiming-and-shipping-a-task.md);
[`fakoli-state release`](#release), [`fakoli-state renew`](#renew),
[`fakoli-state submit`](#submit).

### `fakoli-state release` { #release }

**Synopsis:** Release a claim by `CLAIM_ID`, returning the task to `ready`.
Emits a `claim.released` event with the optional reason.

**Positional arguments:**

- `CLAIM_ID` *(required)* — claim id to release (e.g. `C001`).

**Flags:**

- `--force` *(flag)* — force release even if the claim belongs to another
  actor. Without `--force`, releasing someone else's claim fails.
- `--reason TEXT` *(optional)* — human-readable reason for the release
  (recorded on the event).
- `--actor TEXT` *(optional)* — actor identity; defaults to `$USER` or
  `agent`.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — claim released.
- `1` — `CLAIM_ID` not found, already released, or owned by another actor
  without `--force`.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state release C001 --reason "blocked on upstream PR"
fakoli-state release C002 --force --reason "actor abandoned"
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state claim`](#claim), [`fakoli-state renew`](#renew).

### `fakoli-state renew` { #renew }

**Synopsis:** Extend the lease heartbeat on `CLAIM_ID`. Prints the new lease
expiry and last-heartbeat timestamp. Use this from a long-running agent loop
to prevent the stale-claim reaper from reclaiming the task mid-flight.

**Positional arguments:**

- `CLAIM_ID` *(required)* — claim id to renew (e.g. `C001`).

**Flags:**

- `--actor TEXT` *(optional)* — actor identity; defaults to `$USER` or
  `agent`.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — lease renewed.
- `1` — `CLAIM_ID` not found, already released, expired beyond recovery, or
  owned by another actor.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state renew C001
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state claim`](#claim), [`fakoli-state release`](#release).

### `fakoli-state packet` { #packet }

**Synopsis:** Render a work packet for `TASK_ID` and write it to
`.fakoli-state/packets/`. The packet bundles task definition, parent
feature, completed dependencies, open dependencies, related decisions, and
active claim metadata into a single self-contained artefact for an agent to
execute against.

**Positional arguments:**

- `TASK_ID` *(required)* — task id to render a work packet for (e.g.
  `T001`).

**Flags:**

- `--format {md,json}`, `-f` *(default: `md`)* — output format. `md` writes
  `packets/<TASK_ID>.md`; `json` writes `packets/<TASK_ID>.json`. Stdout
  echoes the rendered content matching the selected format.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — packet written and echoed.
- `1` — `TASK_ID` not found.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state packet T001
fakoli-state packet T001 --format json
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state claim`](#claim) (typically run before
generating the packet); the rendered packet feeds directly into Claude Code,
Cursor, or any MCP-aware agent.

---

## Submit and apply

### `fakoli-state submit` { #submit }

**Synopsis:** Record completion evidence for `TASK_ID`; auto-releases the
active claim and transitions the task to `needs_review`. Emits an
`evidence.submitted` event with the commands run, files changed, optional
output excerpt (truncated to 8000 chars), PR url, commit SHA, and known
limitations. Prints a gate summary indicating whether the recorded evidence
satisfies the task's `required_evidence`.

**Positional arguments:**

- `TASK_ID` *(required)* — task id to submit evidence for (e.g. `T001`).

**Flags:**

- `--commands TEXT` *(required)* — comma-separated verification commands
  that were run.
- `--files-changed TEXT` *(required)* — comma-separated file paths modified.
- `--output-file PATH` *(optional)* — path to a file whose content is used
  as the output excerpt (read with `errors="replace"`, truncated to 8000
  chars).
- `--pr-url TEXT` *(optional)* — pull request URL.
- `--commit-sha TEXT` *(optional)* — commit SHA associated with this
  submission.
- `--known-limitations TEXT` *(optional)* — known limitations or caveats.
- `--screenshots TEXT` *(optional)* — comma-separated paths to screenshot
  files. Required when the task's `verification.required_evidence` includes
  an item matching "screenshot" (the gate checks `evidence.screenshots` is
  non-empty). Default: `[]`.
- `--actor TEXT` *(optional)* — actor submitting evidence; defaults to
  `$USER` or `agent`.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — evidence recorded and claim auto-released. The "evidence gate"
  summary may report INCOMPLETE without changing the exit code (gate
  feedback is informational; the human reviewer decides at `apply` time).
- `1` — no active claim found for `TASK_ID` (run `claim` first).

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state submit T001 \
  --commands "pytest tests/test_auth.py, ruff check src/auth" \
  --files-changed "src/auth/login.py, tests/test_auth.py" \
  --pr-url "https://github.com/acme/api/pull/42" \
  --commit-sha "abc123def"
```

For a task whose `required_evidence` includes a "screenshots" item, attach
the captures with `--screenshots`:

```bash
fakoli-state submit T002 \
  --commands "pytest tests/test_ui.py" \
  --files-changed "src/ui/login_page.py" \
  --screenshots "docs/images/login-before.png,docs/images/login-after.png"
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state claim`](#claim) for the prior step;
[`fakoli-state apply`](#apply) for human review;
[`docs/evidence-buffer.md`](evidence-buffer.md) for the hook-captured
evidence buffer that feeds `--output-file`.

### `fakoli-state apply` { #apply }

**Synopsis:** Human review gate. Without `--approve` / `--reject`: review-only
mode — prints the evidence-gate summary and the current status. With
`--approve`: transition `needs_review` → `accepted` → `done`. With
`--reject`: transition `needs_review` → `drafted` (rework path). Emits a
`task.applied` event with the reviewer, decision, and notes.

**Positional arguments:**

- `TASK_ID` *(required)* — task id to apply a review decision to (e.g.
  `T001`).

**Flags:**

- `--approve` *(flag)* — approve: transition `needs_review` → `accepted`
  → `done`.
- `--reject` *(flag)* — reject: transition `needs_review` → `drafted`.
  Requires `--reason`. Mutually exclusive with `--approve`.
- `--reason TEXT` *(required with `--reject`, optional with `--approve`)* —
  review notes.
- `--reviewer TEXT` *(optional)* — reviewer identity; defaults to `$USER`
  or `human`.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — review decision recorded, **or** review-only mode (neither
  `--approve` nor `--reject`) printed the summary.
- `1` — `TASK_ID` not found; task is not in `needs_review` status; both
  `--approve` and `--reject` were passed; or `--reject` was passed without
  `--reason`.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state apply T001                                      # review-only
fakoli-state apply T001 --approve --reviewer "alex"
fakoli-state apply T001 --reject --reason "missing tests for edge case X"
```

**See also:** [`fakoli-state submit`](#submit) for the prior step;
[`fakoli-state show`](#show) to inspect the submitted evidence.

## Sync

### `fakoli-state sync` { #sync }

**Synopsis:** Run the `ReconciliationEngine` and print a report of any
discrepancies between local state, configured providers, and the event log.
With `--fix`, additionally apply each suggested fix; combine with `--yes` for
CI / non-interactive contexts. Named subcommands (`github`, `provider`) take
over when invoked — this bare form only runs when no subcommand is supplied.

**Flags:**

- `--fix` *(flag)* — after scanning, apply each suggested fix. Requires
  `--yes` in non-interactive mode (stdin/stdout not a tty).
- `--yes` *(flag)* — skip the confirmation prompt before applying fixes.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — scan completed; or scan completed and operator declined the apply
  prompt; or `--fix --yes` applied all fixes successfully.
- `1` — `--fix` was passed without `--yes` in non-interactive mode.

**Example:**

```bash

### `fakoli-state sync github` { #sync-github }

**Synopsis:** Sync tasks against GitHub Issues. Convenience alias for
`fakoli-state sync provider github_issues`. Default (neither `--push` nor
`--pull`) runs both directions. Conflict resolution honours each
SyncMapping's `conflict_resolution_strategy`
(`local_wins`, `remote_wins`, `prompt`, `manual_merge`); `--fix` forces
`remote_wins` on every conflict for this run.

**Flags:**

- `--push` *(flag)* — push local tasks to GitHub only (skip pull).
- `--pull` *(flag)* — pull remote issues to local only (skip push).
- `--watch` *(flag)* — long-running poll loop; Ctrl-C to exit. Each iteration
  is isolated (per-task failures do not kill the daemon).
- `--fix` *(flag)* — reconcile remote state into local on conflicts (forces a
  pull for tasks whose `SyncMapping` is in `conflict` state).
- `--task TEXT` *(optional)* — scope sync to a single task id (e.g. `T001`).
- `--yes` *(flag)* — auto-confirm conflict prompts; defaults to `local_wins`
  in non-interactive mode.
- `--health` *(flag)* — probe provider reachability and auth; print status;
  exit. Does not require an initialised project (useful for pre-init
  connectivity sanity checks).
- `--interval INTEGER` *(default: `60`)* — poll interval seconds with
  `--watch`. Use `0` for a single iteration (test seam).
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — sync iteration completed successfully.
- `1` — provider cannot be instantiated (e.g. missing `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` or
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`); audit emission catastrophic failure.
- `2` — one or more tasks parked awaiting `manual_merge` resolution. Inspect
  files under `.fakoli-state/.sync-conflicts/<TASK_ID>.md`, resolve, delete,
  re-run sync.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state sync github --health
fakoli-state sync github --push --task T001
fakoli-state sync github --watch --interval 30
```

**See also:** [`how-to/syncing-with-github.md`](how-to/syncing-with-github.md);
[`docs/github-sync.md`](github-sync.md);
[`fakoli-state sync provider`](#sync-provider) for the generic form.

### `fakoli-state sync provider` { #sync-provider }

**Synopsis:** Push/pull against a registered sync provider by id. Same
mechanics as `sync github`, but the provider id is supplied as a positional
argument so contributor-registered providers (Monday, Linear, custom
trackers, etc.) can be invoked without a dedicated alias.

**Positional arguments:**

- `PROVIDER_ID` *(required)* — sync provider id (e.g. `github_issues`,
  `monday`, `linear`). On miss, prints the list of registered providers.

**Flags:**

- `--push` *(flag)* — push local tasks only (skip pull).
- `--pull` *(flag)* — pull remote tasks only (skip push).
- `--watch` *(flag)* — long-running poll loop; Ctrl-C to exit.
- `--fix` *(flag)* — reconcile remote → local on conflicts (forces a pull on
  conflict).
- `--task TEXT` *(optional)* — scope sync to a single task id.
- `--yes` *(flag)* — auto-confirm conflict prompts.
- `--health` *(flag)* — probe provider; print status; exit.
- `--interval INTEGER` *(default: `60`)* — poll interval seconds with
  `--watch`.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — sync iteration completed.
- `1` — unknown `PROVIDER_ID`, provider instantiation failed, or audit
  emission catastrophic failure.
- `2` — one or more tasks parked awaiting `manual_merge` resolution.

**Example:**

```bash
fakoli-state sync provider github_issues --health
fakoli-state sync provider monday --push --task T015
```

registration contract; [`fakoli-state sync github`](#sync-github) for the
GitHub-specific alias.

## Hook subcommands (internal — invoked by `hooks.json`)

These commands are called by the plugin's bash hooks (in `hooks/`) — not by
end users directly. They are documented here because they are the
machine-facing surface of `fakoli-state` and contributors writing custom
hooks need the flag list. Every hook subcommand **always exits 0**: hook
failures must never block the calling tool or session.

### `fakoli-state hook check-claim` { #hook-check-claim }

**Synopsis:** Used by `hooks/check-claim.sh` (PreToolUse on Edit / Write /
NotebookEdit). Checks whether `FILE` is within the scope of an active claim.
If `FILE` is in the `expected_files` of a claim owned by a *different* actor,
warns to stderr. Silent in every other case.

**Flags:**

- `--file TEXT` *(required)* — path of the file about to be modified.
- `--actor TEXT` *(required)* — session actor / `session_id`.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — always. Errors are silently swallowed; hooks must never block the
  tool.

**Example (from `hooks/check-claim.sh`):**

```bash
fakoli-state hook check-claim --file "src/auth/login.py" --actor "$SESSION_ID"
```

**See also:** [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) for the hook
contract; `plugins/fakoli-state/hooks/check-claim.sh`.

### `fakoli-state hook record-file-change` { #hook-record-file-change }

**Synopsis:** Used by `hooks/record-file-change.sh` (PostToolUse on Edit /
Write / NotebookEdit). Appends a `file_changed` event to both the SQLite
events table and `events.jsonl` so the audit log has a record of every file
mutation made during a session.

**Flags:**

- `--file TEXT` *(required)* — path of the file that was modified.
- `--tool TEXT` *(required)* — tool name (e.g. `Edit`, `Write`,
  `NotebookEdit`).
- `--actor TEXT` *(required)* — session actor / `session_id`.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — always. Errors are silently swallowed.

**Example (from `hooks/record-file-change.sh`):**

```bash
fakoli-state hook record-file-change \
  --file "src/auth/login.py" --tool "Edit" --actor "$SESSION_ID"
```

**See also:** `plugins/fakoli-state/hooks/record-file-change.sh`.

### `fakoli-state hook capture-evidence` { #hook-capture-evidence }

**Synopsis:** Used by `hooks/capture-evidence.sh` (PostToolUse on Bash).
Appends a JSON record of the bash command (command string, exit code,
stdout excerpt, stderr excerpt, actor, timestamp) to
`.fakoli-state/.evidence-buffer/<CLAIM_ID>.json`. If no active claim is found
for the actor, writes to `.evidence-buffer/orphan.json` with a recovery hint.
Stdout/stderr excerpts are truncated to 4000 chars each.

**Flags:**

- `--command TEXT` *(required)* — full bash command string that was run.
- `--exit-code INTEGER` *(required)* — exit code of the command.
- `--stdout-file PATH` *(optional)* — path to a temp file containing the
  command's stdout.
- `--stderr-file PATH` *(optional)* — path to a temp file containing the
  command's stderr.
- `--actor TEXT` *(required)* — session actor / `session_id`.
- `--cwd PATH` *(hidden)* — project directory. Defaults to cwd.

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — always. Errors are silently swallowed.

**Example (from `hooks/capture-evidence.sh`):**

```bash
fakoli-state hook capture-evidence \
  --command "pytest tests/test_auth.py" \
  --exit-code 0 \
  --stdout-file "$STDOUT_TMP" \
  --stderr-file "$STDERR_TMP" \
  --actor "$SESSION_ID"
```

format and how `submit --output-file` consumes it;
`plugins/fakoli-state/hooks/capture-evidence.sh`.
