# fakoli-state v0 — Build Spec

## Context

`fakoli-state` is the third pillar of the Fakoli plugin ecosystem (`fakoli-flow` = how work moves, `fakoli-crew` = who does the work, `fakoli-state` = what is true). It's a **Claude Code plugin** that provides a local-first, backend-neutral, LLM-optimized project state layer that humans and multiple coding agents can coordinate around. It turns rough ideas and PRDs into reviewed, lockable, agent-ready work packets.

The product is informed by three design documents:
- `agentic_project_state_design_brief.md` — the original vision (PRD authoring, task decomposition, claims/locks, work packets, evidence-based completion, MCP interface).
- `competitive_gap_analysis_agentic_project_state.md` — competitive positioning, especially against CCPM and against issue-tracker-as-state patterns.
- `fakoli_plugin_primer_for_agentic_workflows.md` — the operating model: plugin-first, with skills encoding workflow choreography, hooks enforcing rules, CLI handling pure state ops, MCP as the external surface.

Two distinct wedges define the product:

**Against CCPM and issue-tracker-as-state — the "5 must-do-better" list**:
1. Richer canonical state than issue text (Pydantic models + SQLite vs. issue body markdown).
2. Explicit claim/lock/lease model (not implied by assignment/labels).
3. Better LLM work packets (compact, task-specific, with constraints and non-goals).
4. Six-dimension scoring (complexity, parallelizability, context load, blast radius, review risk, agent suitability).
5. Runtime-neutral integration (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenHands, Copilot, local agents — via CLI + MCP).

**Against the current Fakoli markdown-status-file model — the operating discipline**:
- Canonical state moves from scattered markdown into a durable SQLite database with append-only event log.
- Claims are no longer conventions in `agent-*-status.md` files; they are enforced rows with leases and heartbeats.
- File ownership becomes a real check, not a status-file comment.
- Evidence is required and validated, not just claimed.

The intended outcome of v0 is a usable open-source plugin that demonstrates both wedges and integrates cleanly with `fakoli-flow` and `fakoli-crew`.

## Goals

- Plugin-first packaging following the primer's "maximum use of plugins" reference architecture.
- Local-first by default; canonical state in SQLite under `.fakoli-state/`, never in an issue tracker.
- **Skills** for workflow choreography: start-prd, prd, plan, claim, execute, verify, finish, state-ops.
- **CLI binary** in `bin/fakoli-state` for pure state operations — called by skills, hooks, agents, humans, and external tools.
- **MCP server** (FastMCP, stdio) wired via `.mcp.json`, exposing 13 agent-facing tools.
- **Hooks** that enforce claim discipline, record file changes, and capture evidence — rules the model would otherwise forget.
- **Plugin-owned agents** for state-specific roles (planner, critic, sentinel, state-keeper) that defer to fakoli-crew when it's installed.
- Bidirectional GitHub Issues sync as an opt-in projection of canonical state.
- Auto-generate `agent/<task>-<slug>` branches (optional worktrees) on `claim`; recorded on the Claim.
- Soft review gate: tasks generate freely from any PRD draft; `claim_task` refuses while PRD is `draft`.
- Hybrid LLM model: deterministic template-based PRD parser always available; LLM helpers (Anthropic provider in v0) augment.
- Replayability: full event log in append-only JSONL; replaying from empty reconstructs canonical SQLite state exactly.
- Integration: `fakoli-flow` skills read/write fakoli-state as workflow proceeds; `fakoli-crew` agents consume work packets and submit evidence.

## Non-Goals (v0)

- Hosted SaaS / web dashboard.
- Real-time collaborative editing.
- Multi-backend sync targets beyond GitHub Issues (GitLab, Jira, Linear deferred to v0.2).
- Multi-provider LLM abstraction beyond Anthropic (provider interface present; only one impl ships).
- Webhook-based GitHub sync (polling-only in v0).
- Daemon / long-running service (MCP server is the only long-running process and only per-agent-session).
- Performance benchmarks / regression gates.
- Bundling a single static binary (Python source ships in `bin/`, uv resolves deps on first run).

## Architecture

### Plugin layout

The plugin lives at `~/ai-code/claude-env/fakoli-plugins/plugins/fakoli-state/`:

```

(Full file tree is in the approved plan at `~/.claude/plans/i-need-evaulate-the-ticklish-cherny.md` — this spec is the canonical reference, that plan was the brainstorm output.)

### Per-project state directory

`fakoli-state init` creates this inside the user's project (NOT inside the plugin):

```text
<user-project>/.fakoli-state/
├── config.yaml                # project-level config
├── state.db                   # SQLite — canonical state
├── events.jsonl               # append-only audit/event log
├── prd.md                     # the PRD source
├── packets/                   # generated work packets
└── snapshots/                 # opt-in periodic snapshots (created on first `fakoli-state snapshot`)
```

### Component responsibilities

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| Plugin manifest | Discoverability, versioning, metadata |
| Skills | Workflow choreography — one-question-at-a-time, propose approaches, gate transitions |
| Agents | Specialized workers; defer to fakoli-crew when installed |
| Hooks | Enforcement the model would forget |
| MCP | External capability surface for any agent runtime |
| CLI | Pure state operations — CRUD + computation, no choreography |
| State engine | Backend protocol; SQLite + JSONL impl in v0 |
| Planning engine | Template-first PRD parser; LLM helpers always optional |
| Context engine | Renders work packets (markdown + JSON) |
| Review engine | Pure functions enforcing transition gates |
| Claims manager | Atomic SQLite transactions; stale detection on every op |
| Git ops | Auto-create `agent/<task>-<slug>` branch on claim |
| Sync engine | Bidirectional GitHub Issues sync (polling only) |

### CLI command set

```text
fakoli-state init                  # scaffold .fakoli-state/ in cwd
fakoli-state prd parse             # re-parse prd.md into state
fakoli-state prd review --approve  # transition PRD draft → reviewed → approved
fakoli-state plan                  # generate features + tasks from parsed requirements
fakoli-state score [TASK_ID]       # populate six-dim scores; --use-llm to augment
fakoli-state expand TASK_ID        # break into subtasks
fakoli-state review tasks          # promote drafted → reviewed → ready
fakoli-state list [--status X]
fakoli-state show TASK_ID
fakoli-state next                  # pick highest-priority claimable task
fakoli-state claim TASK_ID [--worktree]
fakoli-state release TASK_ID|--force
fakoli-state renew TASK_ID
fakoli-state packet TASK_ID [--format md|json]
fakoli-state submit TASK_ID --commands ... --files-changed ...
fakoli-state apply TASK_ID         # human review → accepted → done
fakoli-state status                # active claims, blockers, sync state
fakoli-state conflicts             # show conflict groups + overlapping claims
fakoli-state sync [github] [--watch] [--fix]
fakoli-state replay --from-events events.jsonl
```

`start-prd`, full `review`, `verify`, `compact` from the brief move into **skills**; the CLI keeps only the underlying state ops.

**Distribution**: contribute via PR to the fakoli-plugins repo; users install via `/plugin install fakoli-state` from the fakoli marketplace. Python source ships in `bin/src/`; `uv` resolves deps on first invocation. Wrapper scripts shell out to `uv run`.

## Data Model

Pydantic v2 models in `bin/src/fakoli_state/state/models.py` are the single source of truth. SQLite DDL is generated from them at startup (or via `fakoli-state migrate`).

**ID formats**: `T001`, `F001`, `R001`, `T001.1` (subtask), `C001`, `D001`, `E000001`, `V001`, `EV001`.

**Entities** (each = Pydantic model + SQLite table): `Project`, `PRD`, `Requirement`, `Feature`, `Task`, `Score` (embedded on Task), `Verification` (embedded on Task), `Claim`, `Evidence`, `Decision`, `Review`, `Event`, `SyncMapping`, `ConflictGroup`.

**Task lifecycle**:
```
proposed → drafted → reviewed → ready → claimed → in_progress
                                                   ├─→ blocked → in_progress
                                                   └─→ needs_review → accepted → done
                                  reject path:    needs_review → rejected → drafted
                                  stale claim:    claim.stale event returns task to ready
                                                  (claim goes stale; task status does NOT)
```

**Scoring scale** (1-5 per dimension):
- `complexity`, `parallelizability`, `context_load`, `blast_radius`, `review_risk`, `agent_suitability`.
- `complexity ≥ 4` triggers expand recommendation.
- `agent_suitability` drives orchestration routing.

**Work packets** are derived views, regenerated from canonical state. Two forms: markdown (in `packets/T001.md`) and JSON (from MCP `generate_work_packet`).

## Data Flows (summary)

1. **PRD authoring** — `/fakoli-state:start-prd` skill drives dialogue (can bridge to `fakoli-flow:brainstorm`), writes `prd.md` → `fakoli-state prd parse` → `/fakoli-state:prd review` gates draft → reviewed → approved.
2. **Planning** — `/fakoli-state:plan` skill: optionally dispatches `planner` agent (or `fakoli-crew:guido`); `fakoli-state plan` commits skeleton; `score [--use-llm]` populates dimensions; `expand` for `complexity ≥ 4`; `review tasks` promotes drafted → reviewed → ready.
3. **Claim and execute** — `/fakoli-state:execute` (or `fakoli-flow:execute`): `next` → `claim T012` (gate: PRD reviewed) → auto-create branch/worktree → `packet T012` → agent works → heartbeat every 5 min via `renew T012` → `submit T012` (auto-releases claim) → `/fakoli-state:finish` drives apply + ship decision.
4. **Conflict detection** — pre-claim warns (not blocks) on `expected_files` overlap with active claims; `--force` to override; logged. `check-claim.sh` hook ALSO warns on Edit/Write outside claimed scope.
5. **Stale claim recovery** — on every CLI/MCP op, scan claims with expired leases → mark stale, return tasks to pool. `release --force` for manual override.
6. **GitHub sync (bidirectional)** — `sync github`: create issues for new tasks; reconcile changes; conflict resolution per configured strategy. Polling only.
7. **Reconciliation** (`sync` without target) — cross-check SQLite with file system + git; report orphans; `--fix` with prompt.

## Hooks (the enforcement layer)

`hooks/hooks.json` wires four hooks:

| Event | Script | What it enforces |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | `detect-state.sh` | Prints one-line summary: language, fakoli-crew/fakoli-flow availability, active claims, ready tasks, blockers |
| `PreToolUse` (Edit, Write, NotebookEdit) | `check-claim.sh` | Warns if file modified is outside `expected_files` of any active claim; non-blocking |
| `PostToolUse` (Edit, Write, NotebookEdit) | `record-file-change.sh` | Appends `file_changed` event to `events.jsonl` |
| `PostToolUse` (Bash) | `capture-evidence.sh` | Captures stdout/stderr/exit code of registered verification commands into the claim's pending evidence buffer |

All hooks shell out to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/fakoli-state`. None block; they warn, log, capture. Follow `fakoli-flow/hooks/` patterns (no piped grep, no `set -e`, proper `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` usage).

## MCP Server

`.mcp.json` wires `bin/fakoli-state-mcp` as a stdio MCP server. Thirteen agent-facing tools:

```
get_project_summary           list_tasks                  get_task
get_next_task                 claim_task                  release_task
renew_claim                   generate_work_packet        submit_progress
submit_completion_evidence    check_conflicts             get_dependency_graph
update_task_status
```

Errors return structured `{code, message, target_id, payload}`.

## Error Handling

Hard rules:
- **No silent fallback on parse errors**. Surface; leave last-good state intact.
- **No automatic destructive recovery**. `--fix`, `--force`, force-release require explicit flags.
- **Events log before mutation**. Aborted mutations become `error.transaction_aborted`; replay ignores aborted events.

Categories: transition errors (Review engine), concurrency (SQLite BEGIN IMMEDIATE + WAL), schema validation (Pydantic), git failures, GitHub sync, LLM provider failures, recovery via `sync --fix`, hook failures (logged, non-blocking).

`--dry-run` and `--verbose` global flags on every mutating CLI command. All errors logged to `events.jsonl` as `error.*` actions.

## Testing

Layers: unit (<100ms total), component (per-engine with real temp SQLite, <2s/test), CLI integration (Typer `CliRunner`, <5s/test), MCP integration (FastMCP test client, <5s/test), end-to-end (multi-command scenarios, <15s/scenario), hook smoke (bats-style real shell). Full suite under 90s locally.

Hard rules:
- **Real SQLite in every test that touches state.**
- **No `time.sleep` for lease/heartbeat tests.** `Clock` protocol with `FrozenClock`.
- **LLM is mocked.** `LLMProvider` protocol with `RecordedLLMProvider`.
- **GitHub sync via `responses` HTTP mocks.** Nightly `@pytest.mark.live_github` against a real test repo.
- **Git ops use a real local git repo** (tmp `git init` per test).
- **Hooks tested as real shell scripts**.

Coverage targets: 85% overall; 95% on `state/`, 95% on `claims/`, 90% on `review/`, 80% on CLI.

CI matches fakoli-plugins conventions. Steps for fakoli-state: `uv sync` → ruff → mypy → pytest with coverage gate → hook smoke → `scripts/generate-index.sh --check` → marketplace.json regen check. Nightly cron for `live_github`.

## Integration with fakoli-flow and fakoli-crew

`fakoli-flow`:
- `flow:execute` detects fakoli-state; when both installed, dispatches by reading `fakoli-state next` and calling `fakoli-state claim` before each wave. Status files replaced by `fakoli-state submit`.
- `flow:verify` calls `fakoli-state status` and dispatches `sentinel` only on tasks with submitted evidence.
- `flow:finish` calls `fakoli-state apply` per accepted task before merge/PR.

`fakoli-crew`:
- All crew agents gain access to `fakoli-state-mcp` MCP tools when fakoli-state is installed.
- Plugin-owned `agents/critic.md` and `agents/sentinel.md` defer to fakoli-crew when its agents are detected.

When fakoli-state is absent, fakoli-flow + fakoli-crew continue to work via existing markdown-status conventions. Integration is opt-in.

## Critical Files

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest; must validate against marketplace schema. Build first (smith).
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/state/models.py` — Pydantic models; all other modules import from here. Second.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/state/sqlite.py` — Backend impl. Must be correct before any engine work.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/state/transitions.py` — Pure transition table. Drives Review engine.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/claims/manager.py` — Concurrency-critical; test extensively with real SQLite.
- `bin/src/fakoli_state/planning/template.py` — Deterministic PRD parser; defines user-facing template contract.
- `bin/fakoli-state` and `bin/fakoli-state-mcp` — bash wrappers that `uv run` Python modules.
- `skills/state-ops/SKILL.md` — first skill; validates the skill structure.
- `hooks/detect-state.sh` — SessionStart hook; validates hook plumbing.
- `docs/prd-template.md` — user-facing contract for what the template parser accepts.

**External utilities to reuse**:
- **uv** for env + tool install + dependency management.
- **Typer** for CLI.
- **Pydantic v2** for models + validation.
- **FastMCP** for the MCP server.
- **`responses`** library for HTTP-mocked GitHub tests.
- **`gh` CLI** for GitHub sync auth.
- **fakoli-plugins infrastructure**: `scripts/generate-index.sh`, `update-index.yml` GitHub Action, marketplace.json conventions.

## Verification

End-to-end smoke (first public demo per primer):

```bash
/plugin install fakoli-state
fakoli-state init --name "Test Project"
$EDITOR .fakoli-state/prd.md
fakoli-state prd parse && fakoli-state prd review --approve
fakoli-state plan && fakoli-state score && fakoli-state expand T001 && fakoli-state review tasks
fakoli-state next
fakoli-state claim T001                  # auto-creates branch agent/t001-<slug>
fakoli-state packet T001
fakoli-state renew T001
fakoli-state submit T001 --commands "pytest" --output-file out.log --files-changed src/foo.py
fakoli-state apply T001

# Integration
/flow:execute "docs/plans/test-plan.md"

# GitHub sync

```

Test suite + plugin validation:
```bash
cd plugins/fakoli-state/bin
uv run pytest -x --cov=fakoli_state --cov-fail-under=85
uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy src/fakoli_state
cd ../../.. && bash scripts/generate-index.sh --check
```

Replay audit guarantee:
```bash
cp .fakoli-state/state.db /tmp/backup.db
rm .fakoli-state/state.db
fakoli-state replay --from-events events.jsonl
diff <(sqlite3 /tmp/backup.db .dump) <(sqlite3 .fakoli-state/state.db .dump)  # expect: no diff
```
