# fakoli-state roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-05-31 (added the integrity-first 90-day priority track)
**Source of truth:** this file. Archived phase backlogs at [`phase-9-backlog.md`](phase-9-backlog.md) and [`phase-11-backlog.md`](phase-11-backlog.md) are kept for historical audit only — do not add new items there.
**Companion:** [`tech-debt-backlog.md`](tech-debt-backlog.md) for non-roadmap debt (12 OPEN CL/TQ/PS items from PR #41 critics; tracked by origin PR, closed across phases). Items there are not duplicated here unless a roadmap item naturally touches the same file.

## How this is organized

- **Version target** = which fakoli-state minor release the item is planned for.
  - `next` = could land in the next minor (v1.11 candidate); mostly Phase 10 audit carry-forward — mechanical, low-risk, high-leverage.
  - `v2.0` = breaking-change worthy or major capability expansion; provider-protocol scale-out and immediate-apply conflict resolution.
  - `v2.1` = follow-on providers (Jira, GitHub Projects), snapshot subcommand, MCP sync surface.
  - `v2.x` = anytime in the v2 line; doc/composition cleanups and hygiene that don't need a fixed release.
  - `unscheduled` = wanted but not committed; revisit when an adjacent item forces a touch.
- **Theme** = capability group (sync providers, conflict resolution, snapshot/replay, MCP surface, doc agents, hooks, etc.). Themes are durable across versions; an item may shift versions, its theme rarely does.
- **Item IDs** preserved verbatim from origin (`P9B-N` from phase-9-backlog, `P11-XX-XN` from phase-11-backlog) so commit messages, audit cross-references, and the [Phase 10 audit](audits/2026-05-26-plugin-audit.md) stay stable. Every ID in the archived backlogs appears here exactly once (except P11-SK-S5, see [Closed / shipped](#closed--shipped-cross-reference)).

**Status legend** (carried over from origin files):
`OPEN` = unscheduled within target; `TARGETED-VN.M` = scheduled for that release; `SPEC-FIRST` = needs a design doc before implementation; `Phase 11` = Phase 10 audit defer, picks up in the next planning pass.

---

## Priority track: integrity-first (90-day plan)

This track sits above the version buckets below. It is the committed direction
for the next quarter and it is sequenced by credibility risk, not by how
demonstrable each item is. The version buckets (`next`, `v2.0`, `v2.1`) remain
the backlog; this track is what actually gets built first.

> Operating-model principle: sequencing this track by credibility risk embodies
> fakoli-style **P5** (sequence by credibility risk, not demonstrability). See
> [`plugins/fakoli-style/docs/fakoli-style.md`](../../fakoli-style/docs/fakoli-style.md).

### The reframe this track serves

The strategic position is that fakoli-state is the durable, governed state and
audit layer that sits underneath an in-session dynamic-workflow runtime (for
example, Claude Code's Dynamic Workflows). That runtime is single-driver and
in-session: it keeps intermediate results in script variables and discards them
when the session ends. fakoli-state is what remembers, provably, what every
agent actually did.

One honesty constraint shapes the whole track. There is no state interface to
slide "underneath" a session-only runtime today. "Underneath" is earned at the
granularity of the step, through three integration postures:

1. **Beside (ships today).** A workflow script voluntarily shells out to the
   `fakoli-state` CLI or MCP tools (`next`, `claim`, `submit`, `apply`). No
   enforcement.
2. **Governed step (the realistic "underneath").** A thin wrapper a workflow
   step calls instead of raw tool calls: claim, run, capture typed proof,
   submit, apply (gate enforced here). The runtime still drives; every step
   that matters passes through a recorded, gated transition.
3. **Projection (the inversion of their context-economy primitive).** The
   runtime keeps intermediate results out of context in script variables.
   fakoli-state persists those variables as `Evidence` / `Decision` rows, so the
   audit trail is the durable tail of state the runtime throws away.

Two new types make the postures real and back the items below:

- **`ProofArtifact`** replaces free-text `required_evidence` with typed,
  verifiable proofs (`CommandProof{command, exit_code, output_sha256}`,
  `DiffProof`, `LinkProof`, `AssertionProof`). The gate stops asking "does this
  word appear" and starts asking "does a passing CommandProof exist." See SL-3.
- **`OutputContract`** replaces file-level conflict detection with
  interface-level declarations (symbols, modules, endpoints, tables), plus an
  after-the-fact reconciliation that compares the declared contract to the
  actual `DiffProof`. See SL-5.

### Why this ordering (the argument against doing it differently)

The reframe rests entirely on "durable governed state" being trustworthy.
Today the replay guarantee is unproven in CI and the evidence gate was, until
1.17.1, gameable and self-inconsistent. You cannot position as the trust layer
with an untrusted trust layer. So Wave 1 makes the existing claims true, Wave 2
makes governance non-gameable, and Wave 3 builds the integration story on top of
a substrate that has earned it. The temptation to ship the positioning-friendly
items (SL-4, SL-5) first, or to clear the long tidy `P11-*` audit backlog first,
is the temptation to widen the product instead of making its central claim true.
Resist both.

### Wave 1 (Days 1-30): make the claims true

Theme: integrity. At the end of this wave every sentence in the positioning is
backed by a passing CI job.

- **[SL-0]** Unify the evidence gate with the `apply` preview. **SHIPPED in
  1.17.1 (PR #66).** `transitions._evidence_complete` delegates to
  `review.gates.evidence_complete`; a parametrized agreement test locks the
  enforcing gate to the preview gate. Prerequisite for SL-3.
- **[SL-1]** Prove replay in CI. **TARGETED, highest leverage.** Ship
  `fakoli-state replay --from-events events.jsonl` into a scratch database (the
  long-planned P9B-7 / v2.1 item, pulled forward because the audit positioning
  depends on it). Add a CI job that, for a non-trivial fixture project, asserts
  the replayed canonical state is equivalent to the original. Acceptance: a green
  `replay-equivalence` check on every PR. This converts the most-repeated and
  least-proven claim into a verified invariant.
- **[SL-2]** Measure the critic false-pass rate. **TARGETED.** Build a
  fault-injection harness: a corpus of known-bad diffs (off-by-one, dropped null
  check, assertion-free test, deleted assertion) fed to the critic agent;
  measure how many it waves through. Acceptance: a reproducible script plus a
  committed baseline false-pass number in `docs/`. You cannot improve the critic
  until you can score it.

### Wave 2 (Days 31-60): make governance non-gameable

Theme: typed proof. The substrate stops trusting strings.

- **[SL-3]** Ship `ProofArtifact` (typed evidence). **SPEC-FIRST.** Implement the
  typed artifact model; migrate `Verification.required_evidence`
  ([`state/models.py:233`](../bin/src/fakoli_state/state/models.py)); rewrite the
  unified gate ([`review/gates.py`](../bin/src/fakoli_state/review/gates.py)) to
  evaluate typed predicates; make
  [`hooks/capture-evidence.sh`](../hooks/capture-evidence.sh) emit `CommandProof`
  with real exit codes and output hashes. Acceptance: the substring path is
  deleted (not deprecated) and a migration converts existing string
  requirements. Depends on SL-0.
- **[SL-6]** Score spec assumptions, not just tasks. **TARGETED.** Extend the
  six-dimension `Score`
  ([`state/models.py`](../bin/src/fakoli_state/state/models.py), `Score` value
  object) to PRD requirements and surface the highest-blast-radius,
  lowest-confidence assumptions before planning. Acceptance: `fakoli-state plan`
  reports the top assumptions ranked by `blast_radius * uncertainty`, and the
  planner agent must address them before tasks become claimable. This is where
  the human-in-the-loop-at-spec thesis becomes a feature.

### Wave 3 (Days 61-90): earn the reframe

Theme: "underneath," for real. Only now, on a proven substrate.

- **[SL-4]** Promote status-file coordination to canonical state. **TARGETED.**
  Today fakoli-flow / fakoli-crew coordinate by writing and grep-parsing markdown
  at `docs/plans/agent-<name>-status.md` (see
  [`fakoli-flow/references/status-protocol.md`](../../fakoli-flow/references/status-protocol.md)).
  Replace that with state `Event`s; the wave engine reads `fakoli-state` instead
  of parsing prose. Acceptance: the wave engine has zero markdown-parsing code
  paths for status. This is the concrete delivery of "fakoli-flow sits on top of
  fakoli-state."
- **[SL-5]** Contract-level conflict with after-the-fact reconciliation.
  **SPEC-FIRST.** Add `OutputContract` to `Task`; key `ConflictGroup`
  ([`state/models.py:539`](../bin/src/fakoli_state/state/models.py)) on contract
  overlap rather than `expected_files` overlap; add a post-`apply` drift check
  comparing declared contract to actual `DiffProof`. The reconciliation step is
  what lifts conflict detection out of the advisory-only class (the same
  gameability class as the old substring gate: both depend on an honest up-front
  declaration). Acceptance: a test where two tasks touch the same file but
  declare non-overlapping contracts and run in parallel, plus a test where the
  declared contract and the actual diff diverge and a drift `Event` fires.
  Depends on SL-3 (`DiffProof`).
- **[SL-7]** Workflow adapter spike (postures 2 and 3). **SPEC-FIRST, spike not
  product.** Build `fakoli-state workflow-step` (the governed-step wrapper) and
  one worked example wiring a dynamic-workflow script to persist its
  script-variable intermediate results as `Evidence` / `Decision` rows.
  Acceptance: a recorded run where a workflow script's discarded intermediate
  state is queryable in `events.jsonl` after the session ends.

### What this track explicitly defers

The multi-provider sync expansion (P9B-1 Linear, P9B-2 Monday, the v2.1 Jira /
GitHub Projects providers) and the 56-item `P11-*` audit batch stay in the
version buckets below. Adding a third sync provider makes the product wider; it
does not make the central claim more true. None of it belongs in these 90 days.

Semantic indexing (`sqlite-vec`) and a knowledge-graph view are likewise deferred
to after Wave 1. They are useful eventually — semantic dedup of requirements
(SL-6), retrieval of prior decisions, and contract-level conflict modelling
(SL-5) — but they widen the surface before the integrity claims are proven,
which is exactly what this track resists. They must also stay **outside the
replay boundary**: an embedding is model-derived and non-deterministic, so it is
a rebuildable derived index, never canonical state in `events.jsonl`. Captured as
fakoli-style principle **P11** (derived indexes live outside the replay boundary;
distinct from the `P11-*` audit batch below).

## Version: next (v1.11 / v2.0 candidate)

These are the Phase 10 plugin-audit deferrals — 56 live items the five critics raised at SHOULD FIX, CONSIDER, or NIT severity. None are breaking. The bulk close as mechanical batches; see [Cross-cutting themes](#cross-cutting-themes-high-leverage-batches) for the recommended welder fan-out.

### Theme: Audit honesty (mutating-tool input validation)

- **[P11-MC-S1]** All 6 mutating MCP tools (`mcp_server.py:459-464,526-530,572-576,679-684,733-741,972-977`) accept actor as plain `str` with no non-empty validation; empty actor persists into audit trail at every emitted event. Add `_require_actor(name, field="actor") -> str` helper near `_resolve_state_dir`; call as first line of every mutating tool body. _Single helper closes 6 sites; highest forensics-criticality._
- **[P11-MC-S2]** `list_tasks.status: str | None` not constrained — typo like `"in-progress"` or `"DONE"` returns silently empty list. Replace with `Literal[...]` matching `TaskCountsByStatus` fields verbatim.
- **[P11-MC-S4]** `get_next_task` accepts `actor` parameter but never uses it — contract lie. Remove from signature. _Trivial; schema-truthfulness win._

### Theme: MCP schema fidelity

- **[P11-MC-S3]** Return type `list[dict[str, Any]]` / `dict[str, Any]` strips field-level schema from Claude's view across `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `get_next_task`. Define `TaskSummary` or reuse `Task` Pydantic model from `state.models`; drop `json.loads(model_dump_json())` shim. _Closes P11-MC-N1 simultaneously._
- **[P11-MC-C1]** Every tool re-resolves `Path.cwd()` per call; future `os.chdir()` would silently address different project. Capture `_STATE_DIR` at module import.
- **[P11-MC-C2]** `_reap_stale` swallows all exceptions silently; no surfacing in `claude --debug` traces. Add `logger.warning("stale-claim reaping failed: %s", exc)` inside except. _Adjacent to CL-3 in tech-debt-backlog (`_reap_stale_claims` bare except) — close both in the same patch._
- **[P11-MC-C3]** `WorkPacketResponse.content: Any` allowed but narrower union possible. Switch `Any` → `str | dict[str, Any]`.
- **[P11-MC-N1]** `json.loads(t.model_dump_json())` triple-roundtrips data through JSON. Replace with `t.model_dump(mode="json")`. _Closed automatically by P11-MC-S3._
- **[P11-MC-N2]** `DependencyEdge` constructed with `**{"from": dep_id, "to": t.id}` splat to dodge keyword. Add comment or switch to `DependencyEdge.model_validate(...)`.

### Theme: Skill hygiene (no-fuzzy-detection rule)

See [Theme 1](#theme-1--no-fuzzy-detection-rule-across-skills) for batch-fix leverage notes.

- **[P11-SK-S1]** `skills/execute/SKILL.md:8,15,256` — fuzzy detection for `fakoli-flow:execute`. Add Step 0 `claude plugin list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "fakoli-flow"`; branch on exit code. Mirror `start-prd/SKILL.md:48`. **Note:** the grep pattern must NOT use `^` — `claude plugin list` indents each row with `  ❯ ` so a leading anchor never matches.
- **[P11-SK-S2]** `skills/finish/SKILL.md:8,245-246` — fuzzy detection for `fakoli-flow:finish`. Add explicit `claude plugin list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "fakoli-flow"` check at top of Step 1.
- **[P11-SK-S3]** `skills/claim/SKILL.md:15,250` — fuzzy detection for `fakoli-flow` and `fakoli-crew:welder/scout`. Wrap each "when X is installed" section in `claude plugin list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "fakoli-..."` shell check (no `^` anchor) or move prose to `references/composition.md`.
- **[P11-SK-S4]** `skills/finish/SKILL.md:177-212` — fuzzy detection for sync provider availability. Replace prose with `test -n "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY"`, `gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1`, `fakoli-state sync github --health`.
- **[P11-SK-S6]** `skills/start-prd/SKILL.md:194-197` — fuzzy detection for LLM availability. Add explicit `test -n "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"` check; document branches; or move to `references/llm-augmentation.md`.

### Theme: Skill hygiene (phase-status drift)

See [Theme 5](#theme-5--phase-status-table-drift-across-skills).

- **[P11-SK-S7]** `skills/state-ops/SKILL.md:119-132` — phase-availability tables contradict `execute/SKILL.md` (`fakoli-state conflicts` "pending" vs "available"). Reconcile via single `references/phase-status.md`.
- **[P11-SK-S8]** `skills/state-ops/SKILL.md:67-96` — Steps 2 and 3 labeled "Phase 3 — pending" but every other skill uses `list`/`show` as available. Update to "available" matching rest of plugin.
- **[P11-SK-S9]** `skills/state-ops/SKILL.md:1-4` — description is longest in plugin (60+ words), weak trigger phrase. Add concrete trigger phrases in quotes; trim capability list.

### Theme: Skill hygiene (workflow discipline)

- **[P11-SK-C2]** `skills/start-prd/SKILL.md:70-110` — six-question discipline explicit but stopping rule "material" is interpretive. Add concrete stopping rule — max 1 follow-up if under 5 words, never chain more than 8 total.
- **[P11-SK-C3]** `skills/plan/SKILL.md:107-137` — Step 3 documents Phase 7 limitation as 4-step workflow buried in paragraph. Promote to `### Step 3a — Author subtasks manually` block or extract.
- **[P11-SK-C4]** `skills/prd/SKILL.md:76-84` — Step 1 lacks explicit one-question-per-message discipline (weaker than start-prd). Mirror start-prd.
- **[P11-SK-C5]** `skills/execute/SKILL.md:70-84` — Step 2 abort flow happens after packet fetch; dishonest agent skips it. Move Step 2 ahead of packet fetch.
- **[P11-SK-C6]** `skills/finish/SKILL.md:109-116` — `--reason` requirement for `apply --reject` buried in prose. Promote to callout at top of section.

### Theme: Skill hygiene (drive-by NITs)

- **[P11-SK-N1]** `skills/start-prd/SKILL.md:228` — Phase 7 Notes table cell has `\|` escape that may render literally. Use HTML entity `&#124;`.
- **[P11-SK-N2]** `skills/claim/SKILL.md:138-143` — example ISO timestamp drifts vs `execute/SKILL.md:121`. Pick one wall-clock date or use placeholder.
- **[P11-SK-N3]** `skills/state-ops/SKILL.md:22` — "State-ops is NOT for" sentence repeats 4x in one paragraph. Format as bulleted list.
- **[P11-SK-N4]** `skills/prd/SKILL.md:200-215` — Phase 3 Limitations section duplicates content at lines 39-46. Delete one table or merge columns.

### Theme: Hooks (hot-path perf)

See [Theme 3](#theme-3--hot-path-perf-budget-on-hook-scripts).

- **[P11-HK-S1]** `hooks/check-claim.sh:36-59` — hot-path perf budget violation; spawns `python3` twice (100-300ms) on every Edit/Write/NotebookEdit; exceeds declared 200ms. Consolidate into single `python3 -c` printing both fields; mirror `record-file-change.sh:35-58` pattern.
- **[P11-HK-S2]** `hooks/record-file-change.sh:95-106` — hot-path perf budget violation; `_escape_json()` spawns 4 `python3` instances on fallback path; 5-6 total spawns. Move JSON escaping into original extraction `python3` block; emit pre-escaped values.
- **[P11-HK-N1]** `hooks/record-file-change.sh:55-57` — three `printf … | sed -n 'Np'` invocations; each `sed` is a fork. Replace with single `read` / `mapfile`. _Drive-by during P11-HK-S2._
- **[P11-HK-N2]** `hooks/check-claim.sh:95` — `>/dev/null || true` discards CLI stdout; future structured JSON warning silently dropped. Add inline comment cross-referencing CLI subcommand contract docs. _Drive-by during P11-HK-S1._

### Theme: Hooks (contract documentation)

See [Theme 4](#theme-4--hook-contract-undocumented-at-plugin-level).

- **[P11-HK-S3]** `README.md` / new `hooks/README.md` — non-blocking contract undocumented at plugin/doc level; future maintainer will reintroduce `set -e`. Add hook-contract section. _Single-paragraph fix; high-leverage._

### Theme: Hooks (robustness)

- **[P11-HK-C2]** All four `.sh` files — no diagnostic fallback when hook silently fails. Support `FAKOLI_STATE_HOOK_DEBUG=1` env var redirecting stderr to `.fakoli-state/.hook-debug.log`.
- **[P11-HK-C3]** `hooks/detect-state.sh:29` — `$("$CLI" status --hook-format 2>&1)` merges stderr into status line shown to Claude. Drop `2>&1`; capture separately for diagnostic-fallback branch.
- **[P11-HK-C4]** `hooks/capture-evidence.sh:27` + `check-claim.sh:17` + `record-file-change.sh:14` — implicit assumption hook cwd is project root via relative `STATE_DIR=".fakoli-state"`. Replace with `STATE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.fakoli-state"`.
- **[P11-HK-C5]** `hooks/detect-state.sh:14-20` — language detection uses sequential overwrites; polyglot projects mislabeled. Either emit comma-joined list or guard each line. _Cross-plugin coordination opportunity with `fakoli-flow/hooks/detect-context.sh`._

### Theme: Agents (description completeness)

- **[P11-AG-S1]** `agents/critic.md:12-22` — description has only 1 `<example>` block (rubric floor 2; convention 3). Add 2 more with `<commentary>`: one for fakoli-crew fallback path, one for SHOULD-FIX-only verdict.
- **[P11-AG-S2]** `agents/planner.md:12-40` — description has only 2 `<example>` blocks; below 3-example convention. Add a third covering re-planning after PRD rejection / incremental conflict.
- **[P11-AG-S3]** `agents/sentinel.md:12-19` — description has only 1 `<example>` block AND example lacks `<commentary>`. Add 2 more examples + `<commentary>` to every example.
- **[P11-AG-S4]** `agents/sentinel.md:23-28` — `allowed-tools:` used instead of `tools:`. Rename key. _Reviewer may upgrade to MUST FIX for systemic consistency with the 5 Phase 10 MUST FIX agents — costs nothing if bundled with S3/S5._
- **[P11-AG-S5]** `agents/sentinel.md:1-103` — file is 103 lines, at proportionality floor; missing Composition, Inputs, "NOT" boundary, Status File Output sections. Expand to ~140-180 lines mirroring `critic.md` structure.
- **[P11-AG-C4]** `agents/planner.md:76-80` — composition mentions only `fakoli-crew:guido` as defer-to; missing scout/critic acknowledgment. Add one-line note.
- **[P11-AG-N1]** `agents/sentinel.md:103` — missing trailing newline. _Drive-by during P11-AG-S3/S4/S5._

### Theme: Documentation (install messaging, surface counts)

See [Theme 7](#theme-7--install-messaging-drift-in-readme--changelog).

- **[P11-ST-S1]** `README.md:37-48` — install section says "not yet in marketplace" but root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` contains v1.9.0 entry. Replace manual-clone paragraph with `/plugin marketplace add fakoli/fakoli-plugins && /plugin install fakoli-state@fakoli-plugins` flow.
- **[P11-ST-S2]** `CHANGELOG.md:7-14` — `[Unreleased]` opens with past-tense summary of v1.9.0; content already lives under dated section. Trim leading sentence; keep forward-looking v2.x notes.
- **[P11-ST-S3]** `.gitignore:7` — covers `bin/.pytest_cache/` but plugin-root `.pytest_cache/` not ignored locally. Add `.pytest_cache/` so rule survives a future repo split.
- **[P11-ST-S4]** `README.md:17,39,49,190` — internally inconsistent install messaging — 4 different phrasings about "once published". Settle on single install story; sweep all 4 sites. _Batches with P11-ST-S1._
- **[P11-ST-C1]** `README.md` (new section near top) — no top-level surface-count table. Add header: "ships 6 agents, 7 skills, 4 hooks, 0 commands, 1 CLI, 1 MCP server with 13 tools."
- **[P11-ST-C2]** `CHANGELOG.md:9-14` — forward-looking v2.x items name LinearIssuesProvider / MondayBoardsProvider / webhooks without issue/PR links. Append `(see docs/roadmap.md § "v2.0" — P9B-1 / P9B-2 / P9B-5)` or equivalent anchor links.
- **[P11-ST-C3]** `README.md:5-7` — minimal badge set; no CI / test-count badges. Add CI status badge (once live-GitHub nightly workflow public) and `tests: 967` count badge.
- **[P11-ST-N1]** `README.md:132` — "Phase 9 (this release, v1.9.0)" parenthetical will stale on v1.10.0 ship. Replace with "Phase 9 shipped in v1.9.0" for tense-stability. _Drive-by during P11-ST-S1/S4._

---

## Version: v2.0 (breaking-change candidates)

The big-ticket capability expansion. Provider-protocol scale-out (Linear, Monday), the conflict-resolution completion (`*_applied` variants), the spec-first webhook listener, and the config-shape transition that enables per-provider settings.

### Theme: Sync providers (multi-provider expansion)

The `SyncProvider` Protocol shipped in v1.8.0 was deliberately registry-driven so contributors can add providers without engine changes. v1.8.0 / v1.9.0 ship `github_issues` only.

- **[P9B-1]** `LinearIssuesProvider` (`linear_issues`). **OPEN, v2.0.** GraphQL-only API; httpx client with respx mocking. Status mapping needs a per-team workflow inspection step. Step-by-step contributor guide already in `docs/sync-providers.md` § "Step-by-step: add Linear support". Acceptance: provider module + GraphQL transport + full-lifecycle respx tests + `.github/workflows/fakoli-state-live-linear.yml` gated on `LINEAR_API_KEY` secret + `fakoli-state sync linear_issues --health` works.
- **[P9B-2]** `MondayBoardsProvider` (`monday_boards`). **OPEN, v2.0.** Monday has people-columns and per-board custom columns; `provider_metadata` dict carries the bulk of the shape. Auth via Monday API key. REST+JSON (Monday's GraphQL is opt-in per workspace). Same acceptance shape as P9B-1.

### Theme: Sync infrastructure (push-based + conflict completion)

- **[P9B-5]** Webhook-based sync (vs polling). **SPEC-FIRST, v2.0.** `--watch` polls every N seconds; for providers that publish webhooks (GitHub, Linear, Monday, Jira), accept push-based sync via a long-running listener. Webhook secret in `.fakoli-state/config.yaml`; HMAC verification on every payload. Needs design doc first: engine's current "one fetch round-trip per task per pass" assumption does not hold under webhooks (out-of-order events, duplicates, races). Spec scope: `fakoli-state webhook-listen --provider X --port 8080` subcommand, event de-duplication via `(provider_id, external_id, last_modified)` tuple, out-of-order queueing with configurable max-delay, per-provider HMAC verification, polling fallback when listener crashes.
- **[P9B-6]** Immediate-apply `*_applied` resolution variants. **TARGETED-V2.0.** Phase 9 T5 deferred wiring `remote_wins_applied` / `local_wins_applied` per TODOs at `cli/sync.py:1054` and `:1068`. Conflict-safety design (re-fetch on moving target, retry/back-off contract) needs specifying first. Acceptance: `remote_wins_applied` calls `_apply_remote_to_local` inline inside the pull loop; `local_wins_applied` calls `provider.push_task(...)` inline with a defined retry/back-off contract for the race where a parallel remote edit lands between decision and push; `*_applied` tokens join the controlled vocabulary in `docs/github-sync.md`; 4+ new tests in `test_cli_sync.py`.

### Theme: Configuration (provider config schemas)

- **[P9B-9]** Provider config schemas in `config.yaml`. **SPEC-FIRST, v2.0** (co-required with P9B-1 Linear). Current `sync.providers` config key is a flat list; as soon as providers need per-provider config (Linear team ID, Monday board ID, Jira project key + workflow map), the flat list becomes a nested map. Design doc decides: does the new map shape coexist with the flat list, or replace it? Migration path: a list of strings is shorthand for "the listed providers with empty config" — keeps v1.9.0 configs valid.

---

## Version: v2.1 (follow-on capability)

### Theme: Sync providers (workflow-aware integrations)

- **[P9B-3]** `JiraIssuesProvider` (`jira_issues`). **OPEN, v2.1.** Jira's workflow/status taxonomy is per-project; provider needs a one-time discovery call to map fakoli-state's 11 `TaskStatus` values to the project's actual statuses. Auth via PAT + email pair. Acceptance: same shape as P9B-1 plus `--discover-statuses` flag that writes the discovered mapping into `.fakoli-state/config.yaml` under `sync.providers.jira_issues.status_map`.
- **[P9B-4]** `GitHubProjectsProvider` (`github_projects`). **OPEN, v2.1.** Sibling to `github_issues` but for Projects v2 (the newer board surface). Shares the gh-CLI / httpx transport from `github_issues` but addresses a different remote object kind. Probably co-locates in `sync/providers/github_projects.py`.

### Theme: Snapshot / replay

- **[P9B-7]** `fakoli-state snapshot` subcommand. **OPEN, v2.1.** Phase 5 (v1.4.0) removed the pre-created `.fakoli-state/snapshots/` directory because nothing wrote to it. Intent was always to ship a `sqlite3 .backup` wrapper. Acceptance: `fakoli-state snapshot [--retention 30d|count:N]` writes `.fakoli-state/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ.db`; `--list` shows existing snapshots with size + age; `--restore <name>` restores atomically (temp file, swap via rename); documented in `docs/specs/2026-05-24-fakoli-state-v0.md` § Snapshots.

### Theme: MCP surface (sync tools)

- **[P9B-8]** MCP sync tools surface. **OPEN, v2.1.** MCP server (Phase 6) exposes 13 read/mutate tools but does NOT expose `sync_*` tools. Agents that want sync today must shell out via Bash. Acceptance: 4 new MCP tools — `sync_run(provider, *, direction='both', task_id=None)`, `sync_health(provider)`, `sync_status()`, `sync_reconcile(*, fix=False)`. Tool errors map cleanly to `ToolError(message)` with the same exception classes the CLI handles. Documented in `docs/mcp.md` § Sync tools; tests in `tests/test_mcp.py`.

## Version: v2.x (anytime within v2 line)

Hygiene and structural cleanups that don't need a fixed release. Pick up opportunistically when an adjacent welder pass touches the file.

### Theme: Agents (composition deduplication)

See [Theme 6](#theme-6--composition-duplication-across-three-docstate-agents).

- **[P11-AG-C1]** `agents/docs-scribe.md:1-366` — 366 lines (near 400 ceiling); ~60 lines duplicate `marketplace-scribe.md` and `state-keeper.md` composition prose. Extract shared "three doc/state specialists" composition into `docs/specs/internal-agents.md`; link from all three agents.
- **[P11-AG-C2]** `agents/marketplace-scribe.md:1-308` — same composition duplication (lines 144-161, 292-308). Same fix as C1.
- **[P11-AG-C3]** `agents/state-keeper.md:1-293` — same duplication pattern (lines 94-107). Same fix as C1.

### Theme: Skills (subdirectory extraction)

- **[P11-SK-C1]** All 7 `SKILL.md` files — no `references/`, `examples/`, or `scripts/` subdirectories; bodies bundle phase-status tables and composition prose. Extract to `references/phase-status.md`, `references/composition.md`, etc. Closes ~20-30% of SKILL.md body weight. _High leverage — enables Theme 5 (phase-status drift) and Theme 1 (no-fuzzy-detection) batches._

### Theme: Hooks (concurrency hardening)

- **[P11-HK-C1]** `hooks/capture-evidence.sh:232` + `record-file-change.sh:113` — race-prone append on shared files (`events.jsonl`, `orphan.json`); JSON records can exceed `PIPE_BUF` when `STDOUT_EXCERPT` is near `MAX_EXCERPT=4000`. Add `flock` guard OR document at-most-rare interleave and have replay tolerate truncation. _May defer further to v2.x sync-hardening pass._

---

## Version: unscheduled (wanted, not committed)

Items that have a clear fix shape but no compelling forcing function. Revisit when an adjacent item forces a touch on the same file or when a config-driven matcher framework lands.

### Theme: Hooks (config-driven matchers)

- **[P11-HK-N3]** `hooks/capture-evidence.sh:119-128` — hardcoded verification-command pattern list; Phase 6+ TODO already flagged. Track as deferred config-driven matcher. _Aligned with `tech-debt-backlog.md` CL-10 (`capture-evidence.sh` + `gates.py` pattern sets not aligned)._

---

## Cross-cutting themes (high-leverage batches)

Items spanning multiple critics/areas that benefit from cohesive treatment. These come from the [Phase 10 audit](audits/2026-05-26-plugin-audit.md) and supersede the "items by critic" view when planning Phase 11 welder fan-out. Each theme is welder-sized and self-contained.

### Theme 1 — No-fuzzy-detection rule across skills

**Closes:** P11-SK-S1, P11-SK-S2, P11-SK-S3, P11-SK-S4, ~~P11-SK-S5~~, P11-SK-S6 (originally 6 SHOULD FIX items; **5 live** — P11-SK-S5 closed in Phase 10 Fix #6, see [Closed / shipped](#closed--shipped-cross-reference)).
**Pattern:** every skill that conditionally bridges to fakoli-flow, fakoli-crew, a sync provider, or LLM augmentation uses prose-only "when X is installed" framing without a `claude plugin list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "X"` shell check (no `^` anchor — `claude plugin list` indents each row, so the anchored form never matches). `start-prd/SKILL.md:48` and `finish/SKILL.md:249-254` are the reference implementations every other skill should mirror.
**Welder effort:** ~3 lines per site, 5 sites — single welder pass, ~50 minutes.

### Theme 2 — Non-empty actor validation across MCP mutating tools

**Closes:** P11-MC-S1 (1 SHOULD FIX, 6 sites).
**Pattern:** all 6 mutating MCP tools accept `actor: str` / `claimed_by: str` with no `.strip()` non-empty check; empty actor persists into the audit trail.
**Fix shape:** single `_require_actor(name: str, field: str = "actor") -> str` helper near `_resolve_state_dir`; call as first line of every mutating tool body.
**Welder effort:** define helper + 6 one-liners — single welder pass, ~30 minutes.

### Theme 3 — Hot-path perf budget on hook scripts

**Closes:** P11-HK-S1, P11-HK-S2 (and P11-HK-N1 as drive-by).
**Pattern:** `check-claim.sh` spawns python3 twice; `record-file-change.sh` spawns python3 5-6 times. Each cold python3 spawn is 50-150ms; declared budget is 200ms on hot events. Pattern in `record-file-change.sh:35-58` already proves the consolidation works (1 spawn).
**Welder effort:** consolidate each script's extraction + escaping into single python3 round-trip — ~2 hours per script, 2 scripts.

### Theme 4 — Hook contract undocumented at plugin level

**Closes:** P11-HK-S3 (1 SHOULD FIX).
**Pattern:** the non-blocking contract lives only in script-header comments (3/4 hooks have identical "Rules: no set -e, no piped grep, always exit 0, complete in < 200ms" comments) but is absent from README and `docs/`. Future maintainer who hasn't read every script will reintroduce `set -e` and silently break PreToolUse.
**Fix shape:** new `hooks/README.md` OR `docs/hooks.md` section OR README "Hooks" row expansion. Single paragraph: "All fakoli-state hooks are non-blocking: must `exit 0` regardless of internal failure, must not use `set -e`/`set -u`/`set -o pipefail`, must wrap CLI calls with `|| true`, and must complete in < 200ms on hot events. SessionStart hook may take up to 1s."
**Welder effort:** ~15 minutes.

### Theme 5 — Phase-status table drift across skills

**Closes:** P11-SK-S7, P11-SK-S8 (2 SHOULD FIX); enabled by P11-SK-C1 (extract to `references/`).
**Pattern:** `fakoli-state conflicts` is "pending" in state-ops, "available" in execute. `list`/`show` are "pending" in state-ops Step 2/3 but available in every other skill. State-ops is the laggard; the plugin is at v1.9.0 / Phase 10 per the brief.
**Fix shape:** single source of truth at `references/phase-status.md` (or `docs/phase-status.md`); skills link to it instead of inlining tables.
**Welder effort:** create reference doc + update 7 SKILL.md references — ~2 hours.

### Theme 6 — Composition duplication across three doc/state agents

**Closes:** P11-AG-C1, P11-AG-C2, P11-AG-C3 (3 CONSIDER).
**Pattern:** docs-scribe, marketplace-scribe, and state-keeper each carry near-identical "three doc/state specialists inside fakoli-state" composition tables. If the split ever changes, three files need to update in lockstep.
**Fix shape:** extract to `docs/specs/internal-agents.md`; agents link to it.
**Welder effort:** ~1 hour.

### Theme 7 — Install messaging drift in README + CHANGELOG

**Closes:** P11-ST-S1, P11-ST-S2, P11-ST-S4, P11-ST-N1 (3 SHOULD FIX + 1 NIT).
**Pattern:** README has 4 different phrasings about "once published"; CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` narrates the just-shipped v1.9.0; README has stale "Phase 9 (this release)" parenthetical. All four are downstream effects of v1.9.0 shipping without a docs-scribe sweep.
**Fix shape:** single README sweep + CHANGELOG trim. Single docs-scribe pass.
**Welder effort:** ~1 hour.

## Closed / shipped (cross-reference)

Items that originated in the archived backlogs but have already shipped, kept here for cross-reference traceability.

| ID | Title | Closed in |
|---|---|---|
| **P11-SK-S5** | `skills/finish/SKILL.md:247-252` — fuzzy detection for `fakoli-crew:sentinel`; no shell check | **Phase 10 Fix #6** — welder closed this as a bonus while fixing the dangling `/fakoli-state:sentinel` slash-command reference at the same lines. Removed the broken snippet AND added the `claude plugin list 2>/dev/null \| grep -q "fakoli-crew"` shell gate (mirroring `start-prd/SKILL.md:48`), with explicit branches for exit-0 (dispatch fakoli-crew:sentinel) vs non-zero (fall through to plugin-local sentinel agent). The PR-B fix-cycle subsequently dropped the `^` anchor from these patterns once it was discovered that `claude plugin list` indents each row (so `^fakoli-...` never matched). See [`docs/plans/agent-welder-t11-status.md`](plans/agent-welder-t11-status.md) § "Fix 6 approach" for the welder's full decision rationale. |
| P9-1 | Audit-event honesty — `sync.pull.completed` emitted on deferred branches | Phase 9 T5 |
| P9-2 | `local_moved`-only path set `sync_state="in_sync"` instead of `local_ahead` | Phase 9 T5 |
| P9-3 | `SyncAuditPayload` single all-optional model accepted nonsense | Phase 9 T3 |
| P9-4 | `RecordedLLMProvider.record_key` ignored `max_tokens` / `temperature` | Phase 9 T6 |
| P9-5 | Brainstorm-flow bridge used fuzzy detection | Phase 9 T6 |
| P9-6 | `expand --use-llm` had no `--format prd` UX | Phase 9 T6 |
| P9-7 | Multi-provider config — no way to opt out of every sync provider | Phase 9 T5 |
| P9-8 | Two new plugin-owned doc agents — `marketplace-scribe`, `docs-scribe` | Phase 9 T4 |

See [`tech-debt-backlog.md`](tech-debt-backlog.md) § "Phase 8 / Phase 9 closures (sync + LLM cleanups)" for the full implementation detail and test counts on P9-1..P9-8.

## Companion: tech-debt-backlog.md (not duplicated here)

These items remain owned by [`tech-debt-backlog.md`](tech-debt-backlog.md) and are not duplicated into roadmap scope unless a roadmap item naturally touches the same file. Listed here for cross-reference only.

| ID | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CL-1, CL-2, CL-3, CL-4, CL-5, CL-8, CL-10, CL-11, CL-12, CL-13 | PR #41 critics | OPEN |
| TQ-1, TQ-2, TQ-3, TQ-4, TQ-6, TQ-7, TQ-8 | PR #41 Critic-4 | OPEN |
| PS-1 | PR #41 Critic-2 | OPEN |

**Adjacency hint:** Phase 10 finding **P11-MC-C2** (silent `_reap_stale` exception swallow) is adjacent to **CL-3** (`_reap_stale_claims` bare except). The welder closing P11-MC-C2 should consider closing CL-3 in the same patch. Phase 10 finding **P11-HK-N3** (`capture-evidence.sh` hardcoded matcher list) is aligned with **CL-10** (`capture-evidence.sh` + `gates.py` pattern sets not aligned).
