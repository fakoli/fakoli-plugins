## What it is

**(Q)** fakoli-state is a local-first, backend-neutral project-state layer for
humans and AI coding agents — the durable record of every requirement, task,
claim, and piece of evidence in your project, stored in SQLite under
`.fakoli-state/` and exposed through a CLI and an MCP server.

## Who it is for

Developers running Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenHands, or Copilot who need
multiple agents (and multiple humans) to coordinate against the same plan
without overwriting each other. Solo builders who want PRDs that survive
sessions. Project leads who want truth that outlives any one chat.

## The trinity

**(Q)** fakoli-flow defines how work moves, fakoli-crew defines who does the
work, and fakoli-state defines what is true. The three plugins compose: when
all three are installed, `flow:execute` reads `fakoli-state next`, dispatches
the right crew specialist, and submits evidence back to canonical state
before the merge gate. When fakoli-state is absent, flow and crew fall back
to their markdown-status conventions.

## The 5 wedges (vs CCPM, issue-trackers, chat-driven workflows)

1. **Richer canonical state than issue text.** Pydantic v2 models in SQLite, validated at every transition — not free-form markdown in an issue body.
2. **Explicit claim / lock / lease model.** A `Claim` row with an expiry timestamp and heartbeat; stale leases are detected and released on every CLI or MCP call — not assignment-by-label.
3. **LLM-optimized work packets.** `fakoli-state packet T012` renders the exact intent, acceptance criteria, scope, and non-goals an agent needs — not an entire issue thread the agent must summarize.
4. **Six-dimension task scoring.** Complexity, parallelizability, context load, blast radius, review risk, and agent suitability drive routing and expand recommendations — not single-axis story points.
5. **Runtime-neutral CLI + MCP.** The state engine is not coupled to any one agent runtime; the FastMCP stdio server exposes 13 tools to any MCP-compatible client.

## Terraform analogy

**(Q)** fakoli-state is to agentic software work what Terraform is to
infrastructure: a canonical state file holds the truth, derived views (work
packets, markdown plans, dependency graphs) are projected from it, and the
plan-then-apply rhythm gates execution behind review. The PRD is the
configuration; the SQLite database is the state; `fakoli-state apply` is the
commit point that records evidence and transitions a task to `done`. Drift
(stale claims, orphan branches, sync conflicts) is detected and reconciled,
not papered over.

## MCP vs plugin

**(Q)** MCP exposes capabilities; plugins encode operating discipline. The
MCP server ships 13 tools (`claim_task`, `submit_completion_evidence`,
`generate_work_packet`, …) any agent can call, but a tool does not decide *when*
to claim, *which* specialist should execute, *what* evidence is required, or
*how* the critic gate runs. That behaviour lives in skills, subagents, and
hooks — the plugin layer. fakoli-state is plugin-first and MCP-compatible,
not MCP-only.

## Elevator pitch

**(Q)** fakoli-state turns rough ideas and PRDs into reviewed, lockable,
evidence-backed work packets that humans and AI coding agents can execute in
parallel without stepping on each other — the canonical project-state layer
that fakoli-flow and fakoli-crew compose around.

## What it is NOT

- **Not a SaaS.** State lives in your repo under `.fakoli-state/`; no hosted backend, no account, no telemetry.
- **Not a chat memory layer.** Chat history is not a database. State survives session resets, model swaps, and agent runtime changes.
- **Not an issue tracker.** GitHub Issues is an opt-in *sync target* via the bidirectional Phase 8 sync engine — not the source of truth.
- **Not another coding agent.** It is the coordination layer *around* coding agents — work packets in, evidence out.
