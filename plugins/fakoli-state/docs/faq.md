## Getting started

### Do I need a GitHub account or repository?

No. Canonical state lives locally in `.fakoli-state/` (SQLite + JSONL) under
your project root. GitHub Issues is an opt-in *sync target* via the
bidirectional sync engine — never the source of truth. The CLI works fully
offline; `init`, `plan`, `claim`, `submit`, and `apply` make zero network
calls.

If you do want GitHub Issues as an external projection (so non-developers can
read and comment in a familiar surface), set `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and either
authenticate `gh` or export `GITHUB_TOKEN`, then run
`fakoli-state sync github`. The mappings flow both ways and conflicts are
labeled rather than auto-resolved.

See [`design.md` § Why local-first](design.md) for the rationale, and
[`how-to/syncing-with-github.md`](how-to/syncing-with-github.md) for the
setup walkthrough.

### Do I need an Anthropic, OpenAI, or other LLM API key?

No, not for the core flow. The PRD parser, six-dimension scorer, and
dependency inferencer are deterministic and rule-based — they ship as Python
in `bin/src/fakoli_state/planning/` and run with no network.

An `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unlocks three optional `--use-llm` augmentations:
`plan --use-llm` extends short task descriptions, `score --use-llm` adds a
trade-off paragraph to the explanation, and `expand --use-llm` proposes
sub-tasks for tasks with `complexity >= 4`. The numeric scores, task IDs,
dependencies, and status transitions are never touched by the model — the
LLM layer is strictly additive.

`expand` is the only command that *requires* `--use-llm`; everything else
has a deterministic baseline. The default model is `claude-sonnet-4-6` with
ephemeral prompt caching on by default.

See [`llm.md`](llm.md) for the full augmentation contract.

### Which agent runtimes does fakoli-state work with?

Any MCP-compatible runtime. The plugin is built first for Claude Code (where
the skills, agents, and hooks compose natively), but the CLI and FastMCP
stdio server are runtime-neutral. fakoli-state is documented as working with
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenHands, and Copilot.

Two surfaces are always available:

- **CLI** (`fakoli-state <cmd>`) — runtime-agnostic; any shell-capable agent
  can call it via Bash, and humans use it directly.
- **MCP server** — 13 tools exposed over FastMCP stdio. Any MCP client
  connects; tool responses are structured JSON with explicit error
  envelopes.

When a runtime cannot speak MCP (Cursor has no shell, some Copilot modes
have no stdio), the CLI surface is the fallback. Hooks are Claude
Code-specific because they use the SessionStart / PreToolUse / PostToolUse
contract — agents in other runtimes still get full coordination via
claims + leases, just without the editor-time warning.

See [`architecture.md` § CLI / MCP / hooks surface](architecture.md) and
[`_positioning.md`](_positioning.md).

## Day-to-day operation

### My claim lease expired — what happens to my task?

The next mutating CLI or MCP call invokes `detect_and_release_stale()`,
which releases your expired lease with `release_reason="stale"`. The task
returns to `ready` and becomes available to other actors. The audit event
preserves the original claimant, so the history is not lost.

To resume work yourself, run `fakoli-state claim T001` again. If another
actor claimed it in the meantime, the call exits non-zero with
`task already claimed by <actor>`; pass `--force` to take it over (logged
in the audit trail), or run `fakoli-state next` to pick a different
ready task.

Default lease is 60 minutes (configurable in `.fakoli-state/config.yaml`); the lease is extended
by `fakoli-state renew <claim-id>` or by the MCP `renew_claim` tool. Long
honest work should heartbeat every few minutes — see
[`architecture.md` § Concurrency model](architecture.md) for the four
layered mechanisms (SQLite WAL + `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, leases, heartbeats,
stale reaping).

Full walkthrough: [`how-to/claiming-and-shipping-a-task.md`](how-to/claiming-and-shipping-a-task.md).

### Two agents want to work on the same task — what happens?

First to call `claim` wins. The claim transaction runs inside SQLite's
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` mode, so concurrent claimers serialize at the database
layer. The losing call exits non-zero with `task already claimed by <actor>`
and prints the active claim id and lease expiry.

The losing actor's options:

- Run `fakoli-state next` to get the next ready task with no conflict.
- Wait for the lease to expire or for the holder to `release` voluntarily.
- Pass `--force` to override (logged as a `claim.force_released` event so
  the takeover is auditable).

A second safety layer catches overlap *before* the claim attempt: if the
target task shares a `ConflictGroup` with an already-claimed task,
`fakoli-state next` will not surface it and `claim` will warn via
pre-claim conflict check. See
[`architecture.md` § Concurrency model](architecture.md).

### Does `--use-llm` cost money?

Yes — Anthropic charges per token. The deterministic path is free and
always available. The LLM layer is opt-in per command.

Cost-shaping defaults are in place: `temperature=0.0` for repeatability,
and prompt caching is on by default (every Anthropic call sends the system
block with `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}`). A typical `score
--use-llm` run against a 20-task batch hits the 5-minute ephemeral cache
on tasks 2–20 and pays only for the cold system block plus per-task user
and output tokens.

Per-call output ceilings are bounded by named constants:
`_SCORE_EXPLAIN_MAX_TOKENS` (300), `_DESCRIPTION_ENRICH_MAX_TOKENS` (400),
and `_EXPAND_MAX_TOKENS` (2000). `expand` is the heaviest call but is
gated on `complexity >= 4` and invoked one task at a time.

If the LLM call fails mid-operation, the engine falls back to the
deterministic baseline and emits a stderr warning — the operation never
aborts mid-batch. See [`llm.md` § Cost notes](llm.md).

### How do I migrate from `agent-*-status.md` markdown files?

There is no shipped migration tool. The recommended path is:

1. `fakoli-state init --name "<project>"` — scaffolds `.fakoli-state/`.
2. Author `.fakoli-state/prd.md` against the schema in
   [`prd-template.md`](prd-template.md). Existing intent / acceptance
   criteria from your markdown status files map cleanly into PRD task
   blocks.
3. `fakoli-state prd parse` then `prd review --approve` to promote the
   PRD to `approved`.
4. `fakoli-state plan` then `score` to materialize tasks and dependencies.
5. Once tasks exist in the database, the old `agent-*-status.md` files can
   be deleted. Their role (per-agent status notes) is replaced by claim
   rows, evidence, and the `events.jsonl` audit log.

An automated importer is not on the roadmap — PRD authoring is a thinking
exercise as much as a data-entry one, and copy-pasting forces the author
to revisit intent. Community contributions for a migrator would be
welcome; open an issue describing your source format.

See [`how-to/getting-started.md`](how-to/getting-started.md) and
[`how-to/authoring-a-prd.md`](how-to/authoring-a-prd.md).

## Hooks, storage, and concurrency

### How do I temporarily disable a hook?

The four hooks are wired in
[`hooks/hooks.json`](../hooks/hooks.json) at the `SessionStart`,
`PreToolUse`, and `PostToolUse` events. To disable one without
uninstalling the plugin, comment out or delete the relevant block in
`hooks.json` and restart your Claude Code session.

All four hooks are non-blocking by design — they `exit 0` regardless of
internal failure, never use `set -e` / `set -u` / `set -o pipefail`, and
wrap CLI calls with `|| true`. A hook that errors out internally already
behaves like a disabled hook: it warns once to stderr and gets out of the
way. See [`design.md` § Why hooks are non-blocking](design.md).

If you want a hook off without editing `hooks.json`, rename the script
file (e.g., `mv hooks/check-claim.sh hooks/check-claim.sh.off`) — the
manifest's `command` reference will fail to resolve and the hook becomes a
silent no-op. To debug a hook that is misbehaving, run the script directly
from a shell to inspect its stderr; a `FAKOLI_STATE_HOOK_DEBUG=1` env var
that redirects hook stderr to `.fakoli-state/.hook-debug.log` is tracked
as a Phase 11 backlog item ([P11-HK-C2](roadmap.md)) but does not ship
today.

### Where does my data live, and should I commit it to git?

Everything lives under `.fakoli-state/` in your project root:

```text
.fakoli-state/
├── config.yaml         # project-level config (sync providers, lease defaults)
├── state.db            # SQLite, WAL mode — the canonical state
├── events.jsonl        # append-only audit log (replay source)
├── prd.md              # PRD source (you edit this)
└── packets/            # generated work packets (per-task markdown / json)
```

Two valid commit policies, both supported:

- **Commit everything.** State, audit log, and packets all survive
  `git clone`. Simplest for solo work or small teams. Beware: `state.db`
  is binary and merge conflicts are unrecoverable manually (use replay
  instead).
- **Gitignore `.fakoli-state/state.db` (and `*.wal`, `*.shm`) but commit
  `events.jsonl`.** The replay guarantee means `state.db` is regenerable
  from the event log; this avoids binary merge conflicts while preserving
  audit history across clones.

The CLI and hooks resolve `STATE_DIR` relative to
`${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}/.fakoli-state`, so every invocation
addresses the same project regardless of cwd. See
[`architecture.md` § Storage layout](architecture.md) and
[`design.md` § Why local-first](design.md).

### Can I inspect state with `sqlite3` or SQLite Browser?

Yes. `.fakoli-state/state.db` is a standard SQLite file in WAL mode — any
SQLite tool works.

```bash
sqlite3 .fakoli-state/state.db .schema
sqlite3 .fakoli-state/state.db "SELECT id, status, title FROM tasks;"
```

The schema is version 3 as of v1.10.0 (unchanged since v1.8.0 — no
migration required). Pydantic models in
[`bin/src/fakoli_state/state/models.py`](../bin/src/fakoli_state/state/models.py)
define every entity; the SQLite implementation lives in
[`bin/src/fakoli_state/state/sqlite.py`](../bin/src/fakoli_state/state/sqlite.py).

Read-only inspection is safe and concurrent — WAL mode lets readers
proceed without blocking the CLI's writers. Do not edit rows directly:
state mutations should go through the CLI or MCP server so the
corresponding event lands in `events.jsonl` (the replay guarantee depends
on every mutation being represented in the log).

## Backup and recovery

### How do I back up `.fakoli-state/`?

Copy the directory wholesale:

```bash
cp -R .fakoli-state /backup/location/fakoli-state-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

That captures `state.db`, `events.jsonl`, `prd.md`, `config.yaml`, and any
generated packets. Restore by copying back. Because `state.db` is in WAL
mode, also capture the `*.wal` and `*.shm` sidecar files if the database
is open at copy time — or shut down active sessions first.

The replay guarantee (see next question) means `events.jsonl` alone is
enough to reconstruct `state.db` byte-for-byte, so the audit log is the
*minimum* you must preserve. Commit `events.jsonl` to git and you have a
distributed backup for free.

A native `fakoli-state snapshot` subcommand (`sqlite3 .backup` wrapper
with retention) is planned for v2.1 — see
[`roadmap.md` § v2.1 → Snapshot / replay](roadmap.md). Until then,
`cp -R` is the supported flow.

### What if `state.db` gets corrupted?

Restore from a backup of `.fakoli-state/` (the directory is safe to `cp -R`
— see the previous question). The fastest recovery path today is:

```bash
# Back up the broken db (for forensics), then restore from your last backup.
mv .fakoli-state/state.db .fakoli-state/state.db.broken
rm -f .fakoli-state/state.db-wal .fakoli-state/state.db-shm
cp /backup/location/fakoli-state-YYYY-MM-DD/state.db .fakoli-state/state.db
```

The replay guarantee is the central audit property of the engine: replaying
every event from `events.jsonl` against an empty database reconstructs
canonical SQLite state exactly. That property is what makes `events.jsonl`
the *minimum* you must preserve — commit it to git alongside the repo and
you have a distributed audit log for free, recoverable from any clone even
if every local `state.db` is lost.

A native `fakoli-state replay` subcommand that consumes `events.jsonl` and
rebuilds `state.db` byte-for-byte is on the roadmap but not yet shipped —
see [`roadmap.md` § v2.1 → Snapshot / replay](roadmap.md) (item P9B-7,
co-required with the snapshot subcommand). Until then, restore from a
filesystem backup; the audit log is preserved in git.

Event ids are assigned inside the mutating transaction, not before it, so
the JSONL ordering is consistent with the SQLite commit order. See
[`architecture.md` § Event log and JSONL replay](architecture.md).

## Roadmap and contributing

### When will Linear, Monday, or Jira support land?

Per [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md):

- **v2.0** — `LinearIssuesProvider` (GraphQL transport, item P9B-1) and
  `MondayBoardsProvider` (REST + JSON with people-columns, item P9B-2).
  Both are OPEN and in development. Webhook-based sync (P9B-5) is
  SPEC-FIRST for the same release.
- **v2.1** — `JiraIssuesProvider` (per-project workflow discovery,
  P9B-3) and `GitHubProjectsProvider` (Projects v2 board surface,
  P9B-4). Both OPEN.

The `SyncProvider` Protocol shipped in v1.8.0 was deliberately
registry-driven so contributors can add providers without engine
changes. If you want to add one now rather than wait, see the next
question.

### How do I write my own sync provider?

Implement the `SyncProvider` Protocol from
[`bin/src/fakoli_state/sync/provider.py`](../bin/src/fakoli_state/sync/provider.py)
and register it in
[`registry.py`](../bin/src/fakoli_state/sync/registry.py). The
`GitHubIssuesProvider` at
[`sync/providers/github_issues.py`](../bin/src/fakoli_state/sync/providers/github_issues.py)
is the reference implementation — read it alongside the contributor
guide at [`sync-providers.md`](sync-providers.md), which walks through
the Linear case step by step.

Per-provider acceptance criteria (from `roadmap.md` § v2.0): provider
module + transport (GraphQL or REST) + full-lifecycle respx tests +
live nightly workflow gated on the provider's API key secret +
`fakoli-state sync <provider_id> --health` works.

Provider config schemas in `config.yaml` (item P9B-9) are co-required
with the first new provider — that work is SPEC-FIRST and tracked
in the same v2.0 milestone.

### How do I contribute?

Open a pull request against
[github.com/fakoli/fakoli-plugins](https://github.com/fakoli/fakoli-plugins).
A formal `CONTRIBUTING.md` is forthcoming; the closest current pointer
is the README's "Status" section and the
[`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) item taxonomy (Phase 11 backlog items
prefixed `P11-XX-XN`, Phase 9 carry-forward items prefixed `P9B-N`).

Three contribution shapes most appreciated right now:

- **Sync providers.** Linear / Monday are first-party v2.0 work but
  community implementations are welcome. Follow
  [`sync-providers.md`](sync-providers.md).
- **Phase 11 backlog batches.** 56 SHOULD FIX / CONSIDER / NIT items
  tracked in [`phase-11-backlog.md`](phase-11-backlog.md); the
  cross-cutting themes in `roadmap.md` indicate which items batch
  cleanly.
- **Test coverage.** v1.10.0 ships 965 tests; the live-tests doc at
  [`live-tests.md`](live-tests.md) describes the nightly workflow.

For new architectural choices (a second backend, a daemon, a webhook
listener), write a SPEC-FIRST design doc under `docs/specs/` before
opening a PR — the SPEC-FIRST roadmap items are the precedents to
mirror.
